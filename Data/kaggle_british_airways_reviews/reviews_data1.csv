yes,"     i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day. initially my flight was delayed in denver by 3 hours. as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw. the denver to heathrow flight was terrible. the plane was dirty, i was in economy, i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability. the plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus. passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw. this plane was the smallest 3x3 plane i have seen. packed in like sardines. my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami. ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there. i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day.

yes,"     booked a ba holiday to marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit, i can now confirm that the points have been credited. it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on 2nd january, looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge. keep it up ba, loyalty is indeed a 2way street.",yes
yes,"    extremely sub-par service. highlights: no online meal selection. staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. plates were literally grabbed away. i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. no apology. no offer of a napkin. i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. because the seat before me was so tilted, i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. staff walked down with some water and biscuits. this got exhausted just before she got to me. she just looked at me and walked away. nothing further was offered.",no
yes,"     i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago, writing off my avios and opting for other airlines. but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good. the aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. a particular shout-out to a flight attendant called jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. i'm going to have to start spending those avios.",yes
yes,"     i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland, but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight. the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. while the food was typical air plane food. i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights.",yes
yes,"     british airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. i have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. customer service had such a thick accent i didn't think they were speaking english. ",no
yes,    flew from amman to london on nov. 14 2022. not sure what type of aircraft it was. my ticket was economy plus. the flight is 5h35m. we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. any other food or drink had to be purchased. so we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. will honestly never fly them again if i can help it.,no
yes,"    this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline. i flew with british airline on august 21st 2022. i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport. i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport, and that was on august 21st. i waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). when i did not receive any update on my lost bag, i filed a claim for compensation, and that was on september 11th. since then, i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. every time i talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. this whole experience was a hassle. very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba.",no
yes,"     flying lhr t5 to cpt november 2022:  ba app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. lhr t5 smooth and calm. checking process quick. - but boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  ran back to checkin to get correct one. bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in cape town).  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges. turns out this was false information ... b pier lounge was open. but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -arrived late to the gate (train not working). there was a biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition. food average. wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). overall experience 2/10. flew air france (fortalaza to cdg to lhr) two weeks earlier which was way better. how embarrassing for ba.",no
no,"  worst experience ever. outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified. i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. on top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag i had. extra wait in milan then. food is horrible.",no
yes,"     check in was a shambles at bwi, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. once on board, the fas were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad. the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. i was seated in an aisle seat (row f) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful ife screens. the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. on lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. overall, i rate this just as a mediocre journey.",yes
yes,    beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ba. two pieces reported 29th september. ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.,no
yes,"    on july 19th 2022 i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which i had provided all copy of receipts for. i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, i sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks i will be receiving it. it's 4 months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter.",no
yes,"     i booked the flight on oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. but in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. so i requested cancellation, but ba canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? i assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, i still have not received any refund, so i reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba. i tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. given all i have experienced, i have zero faith in british airways.",no
yes,     london to gibraltar on 25th october 2022. i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late. the a320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. the staff disappeared for most of the flight. the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. ,no
no,"   i’ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route i’m after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. we should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. they couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. they were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. we’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march. this was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !",no
yes,"     a great flight. the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. british has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. service was ok, i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. entertainment was good as was connectivity. no real complaints except a minor one. the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. i actually felt like i was in a true business class, not by qatar’s standards, but that’s another story.",yes
yes,"     i am happy to say that this flight was quite good. except for the second rate euro business seating, everything was very well done. a friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit. well done. unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival.",yes
yes,"     just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys.",no
yes,"     a very positive experience with ba. seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. food was fine but not outstanding. wi-fi good, and video screen large and bright. baggage came out very quickly at heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta. all in all, would fly ba again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats.",yes
yes,"    baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. my second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. a380 is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)",no
yes,"     evening flight from lhr to iad on an a380. check in at t5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. boarding was very poorly managed. the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. the flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. they did their job very professionally and efficiently. they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. all in, it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention.",yes
yes,"     we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on 4th october, there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews. the woman at the counter was rude, i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time. shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. on the flight from london to san francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, i spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america. once we boarded, it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken. the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. so, after getting off the flight, i decided to make a complaint to british airways. bearing in mind that i had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. i paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. all they have now offered me is a £50 ba voucher, which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example i hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. after all my experiences with ba, i will not be using them again. very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain.",no
yes,"     while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating. i got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. ",no
no,"   lhr-lax. i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow. t5 is a whole other story. once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before. anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. the entertainment system was good with decent options, so i occupied my time with several movies. nice landing at lax. all in all ba was just fine.",yes
yes,"     flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite - a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world. boarding easy. took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. bedding and large pillow supplied. attentive fa's - especially anna who addressed me by name). however, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). and, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. refused to pay ba's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. c'mon ba - do we not pay enough already to travel club class ? i can recommend ba's new club class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future.",yes
yes,     i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick. entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. flight on a380 left on time. few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. decent snack and slept well. arrivals lounge excellent. would recommend.,yes
no,"  london to cairo. first, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. even southwest is more generous. when unable to connect my phone to order food, i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour. when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. he used his phone to place the order.",no
yes,"     this review is specifically about maddie, crew member who took care of us. she was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. smiling from start to finish. she should be the brand ambassador for ba.",yes
yes,"     5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase.",no
no,"   dfw-lhr. had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london. first ride on an a380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. the seat itself wasn't too bad but i felt squished and locked in. on a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely, but i'm not sold on the a380. t5 at lhr is another story that will be in a different review. what a mess that place is.",yes
yes,     check in at jersey straightforward. there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr. captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at heathrow. good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t5 was as long as the flight!,yes
yes,"     check in at lhr t5 was very quick and queue for security short. we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. flight boarded on time. whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. glass of champagne, coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. in spite of some of the issues with ba, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly.",yes
yes,"    the check-in process was smooth. i got access to the iga lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge. on board was what all this flight was about. this was my first time flying intra-european business class, and though i was well prepared, i still found it underwhelming. first, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. there is no personal ife, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago. i could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. also, the 32 passengers shared one single wc, meaning a long line for the bath room, something i have rarely seen in business class. arrived at lhr, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. it finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t5, such things will affect their reputation.",no
yes,"    this is my first time flying ba's new club suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. flight to the us, including mine, departed from concourse c of terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. however, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. the highlight is the club suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. at least the food tasted good, which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights, even in first class.",yes
yes,"     my 7am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. they did not work with me as i miss 2 days of conference. they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden (stockholm); which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice - but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself. upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure, i saw a direct flight to heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. so i changed to 8.15am from gothenburg - heathrow - jersey. however, at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp 710 as i “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense. i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation i’m entitled to according to uk law, but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination. if i have a choice, i will never travel ba again. such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.",no
no,"   i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey! i don’t know how you manage to keep smiling. couldn’t fault anything. helpful, reassuring, excellent food and i can’t wait to fly again. thank you and i really appreciated you.",yes
yes,"     british airways personnel was just magnificent. my flight into london was delayed, security had long lines, i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). this while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. i was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board. i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic. i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance. thank you for all you do !",yes
no,   good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39j and lack of good leg room. meal was good from singapore. should be more snacks on board. my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t work.,yes
yes,     flight was 1 hour late leaving gate. crew were friendly. seats comfortable. but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps.,yes
yes,"     london to istanbul. british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. front rows about 5-7 are considered as business class, with very short leg space.  no pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing me. no curtesy for business class check-in while waiting for flights. ",no
no,  london to manchester. british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour. the staff were no help and frankly rude.,no
no,   flight was cancelled at the last minute due to “weather” despite pretty much all other flights not being affected. booked onto a flight the next day. arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead t5. horrendous check-in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight. the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done.,no
yes,"     after having a few not so good experiences in the past, i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved. first of all, the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive. the buffet was a joy. we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express. wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! also may i add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. i am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports.",yes
no,"   this review is for ba booking system not a flight . today i clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. i then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way. i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didn’t want. however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. so they now have my money and i have to re-book at full cost. in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up.",no
yes,     manchester to seattle via london. i will never fly ba again. they cancelled my return flight from heathrow back to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester. the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. i will not be flying ba again,no
yes,"     our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. we had to stay overnight for the next day flight. we still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. during this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). this should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. we were given a voucher. this voucher was only bookable by phone. when i phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone. you can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? all i have been offered is another voucher. the time to use has passed. it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. we returned home with aer lingus with no drama.",no
no,"   i sat in seat 25c. our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy. she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways.",yes

yes,"     i was told i'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into philippines. booked my trip via ba.com, with a transfer in singapore. they delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when i try to check in at changi airport, the philippines airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel, book my own flight to manila, then also the return journey back to london. if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience.",no
yes,"     having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, i boarded the plane on this basis. i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. there was no help at there to find a hotel. i have ms and can't walk without help, ba did nothing, their partners iberia did nothing. at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. i lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. ba insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. i would not have got on the plane had i known. i found out i could go to arbitration. ba now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if i do. their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. for someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers. so for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with ba.",no

no,"   my husband, parents who are in their 80’s and i were traveling back to ny from naples, italy and had a stopover at heathrow, london. let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny. the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us. she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! she is so kind and is amazing at her job.",yes
no,"   on our recommendation my son and his young family (child 4 and baby 9 months) and wife, flew ba to the usa from cape town, leaving yesterday evening. just got off the call with him, after their arrival at heathrow. shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from rsa, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. my grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the ba response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate.",no
no,"   we had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. nice start to a 3 week trip to england.",yes

yes,"     customer service is non-existent. for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on ba.com i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, my sister and husband had tickets on the july 18 from nairobi to jfk. when ba received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. it took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. the ticket was in premium economy. when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. where is the efficiency? where is the empathy? where is the decency? in addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. also when i made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company",no

yes,"     my wife and i booked a flight in april 2022 that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington. when we checked in at edinburgh airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  we were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. we waited and then finally at 1:15 pm, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 pm flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london. we were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. when we got to security check area the line was massively long. we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. we decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “fast track” security to make our flight. we got to the gate in time. yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in london 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. when we got to the check-in counter area a ba staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. when we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (iad), but to baltimore. i was not told or assured i’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim on-line. this ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the uk.

no,"   decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. flight on 18th june-2022 from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. we received a 10 cad voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam (from london), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam. when we left the airplane in london, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. after 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  at some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. this flight was about to leave tuesday morning (it was sunday 5pm when we arrived in london). this meant we have to spent 2 additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands. we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. they released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us. we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands. seems british airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight. ",no
no,   reasonably smooth boarding. meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.,yes
yes,"     three flights, london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london. generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. flights operated generally close to the advertised times. but ba was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. in preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in business class passengers). why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? this was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. it would make much more sense to board people at the back first. and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. the small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris. at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",yes

yes,"     over 1 week ago i cancelled 2 club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before. they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher, so i opted for this online. since then, absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). as a very loyal ba customer for more than 40 years, i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. with a further 6 bookings with ba planned for the rest of 2022, i have to admit that travelling with them (ex lhr) has now become an absolute nightmare.",no
no,   flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down. luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report. within 24 hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. would definitely give ba a 5 star rating and have them again.,yes
yes,"     check in and security at lhr efficient. went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service. left from b gates. efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. this was my first time on the club suite. travelling with 2 children. ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good. on time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. we don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. overall a good flight.",yes
yes,"    washington to london. our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). when we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!",no

no,"   today, my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport. all apparently went well from check-in through the flight. after that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. i found a ba service person to ""help"" me. he told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  i thought, one of our bags made it. then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. so, i assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. i was then told to file a claim on ba.com which we did. at this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! now, i've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). ba doesn't seem to have anything like this. in this case, again, it appears ba cannot even locate the bag. i hadn't flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again.",no

no,"   i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points. i then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as i didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of 4? the email also stated that if i wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, i could get a full refund of the money i had paid. i called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and i paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable.",no
yes,"     departure was about 40 minutes late. the a350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, i gave up trying to watch. the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. i am going to explore other options before using ba again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.",no

yes,"     ba cancelled my flight, i never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees.  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april 29th 2022 from hong kong to london. they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date; covid ticketing flexibility assurances? couldn't find a flight up to and including october. so i opted for the refund thinking i'd get a full refund. i was refunded about 1/5 of what i paid. i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and i didn't get a full refund. each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. and thats where the frustration begins. the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. a month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what i paid. it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up. so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why i wasn't getting a full refund. i didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk. after another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation. we're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022. your claim's been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. further to your request, i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. thanks again for following this up with us. please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. best regards british airways customer relations"". i don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. i am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company.",no

no,"   the customer service of british airways is really bad. you can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. now, i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing ba's low quality customer service. not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (ldn-jnb) is really low quality. other airline operators which are working with do&co for flight catering are way better than ba. i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from do&co. overall my rating is 2/5 for ba - you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them. note: respect to their cabin crew",no
yes,"    ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone. ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. you pay extra for absolutely nothing.",no
yes,"     this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays. the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. plus - helpful and friendly fa. minuses - the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. it was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the fa found it difficult. the in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, tv programmes and music. the food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. i don't know what the business class offerings from ba's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia.",no
yes,"     as a regular ba customer on european flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays. staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew. the benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly ba is in a time warp over this. ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. the food standards and choices in the t5 first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid. inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in club europe only 4 salad options were available. no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. it appears there is no supply control in place at ba. food quality was okay, but while do&co supply this, the do&co meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages (i flew turkish 10 days ago). staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin. i end where i started, ba standards continue to slip. ",no

no,"   i could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding. however, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. the most recent time i have called them, is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if i don’t?”. after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. i did not book with westjet/nor is this westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone). i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to. this has been completely disheartening. please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication. i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before.",no
yes,"     the a80 is a wonderful aircraft - quieter than any other aircraft i've flown. flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london, which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed. passengers waited almost 90 minutes at london terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our baggage will arrive ""soon."" onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support. meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. overall, a fairly disappointing experience with ba.",no
yes,"     lhr to sfo in new club suite. rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers. pushback delayed by lack of tug. club suite seats (2k/3k) a huge improvement over previous cw product, with excellent ife and a good range of movies. cabin crew attentive and efficient. food adequate and still served on the same tray. arrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge. long queue to get through immigration.",yes
yes,    covid form is broken - called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone. 1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane. i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have 3 hours drive left after i arrive at the airport. in short: totally not customer friendly. will try to avoid flying next time with ba.,no
no,"   feels like ba are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. however it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! i drank wine anyway but i wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. i've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout). water eventually came round after we'd eaten. as i say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. food was forgettable. in-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. not fun on a night flight with turbulence. loos on this gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. check-in queue at cancun took forever. couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. grateful for priority boarding in this situation. bags arrived ok at gatwick, no delay. i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative. ba's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?",no
no,"   phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg. despite a 4 hour layover in heathrow, bags didn't make it onto the connecting flight. once in hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. absolutely miserable customer support. our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again.",no
yes,"     worst airline experience ever. flew 7 people business class. check in was a disaster. the claimed i had “exchanged” tickets. after 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. we were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. the ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone. this airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them.

yes,"     outstanding inflight service from the crew. friendly, professional and helpful. the very best of british. even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver, it didn’t matter. the crew made the flight outstanding.",yes
yes,"     recent trip to boston, departing lhr t5. ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us, they were really friendly and personable. very short queues for bag drop and security, i would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment. boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. the cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. the food by do&co was exceptional, i don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-atlantic flight in economy. it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. i would definitely consider flying with them again.",yes
no,"   my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.. but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time. we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic. unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively. the flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by air canada / swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment.",yes
yes,"     as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. we were booked to fly from zhr-lhr on a miles ticket in february 2022. when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. at the 3rd attempt, after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake.",no
no,"   boarding on time, but unfortunately from ort’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond ba’s control. crew were good but lacked the personal touch. old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. the cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. overall a decent flight.",yes
yes,"     flight delays can happen, but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond. our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line. a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline.",no
yes,"     check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. easy boarding in sequence numbers. seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice coca-cola, water or red wine. the connecting flight from lhr - man was cancelled with no contact from the airline, i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. the outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of terminal change at lhr from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again.",no
no,"   british airways - travel with confidence. probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in 2022. late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may. guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline. my suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. any airline.",no
no,   business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat - not much more comfortable than economy. meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 (out of 8 in business class) and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class.,no
yes,     we arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible. the airport security lines were not managed well. the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced. ,no
yes,"     ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, i need to change my flight. i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will - that was apparently a lie. they actually give me a voucher. to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week.  i am panicked so i try calling them. of course, calling them does nothing. the hotline says that they are too busy. this happens again and again. so, i give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. luckily it shows up quickly, and i rebook. then i need to change my booking again. i go to request a voucher again. this time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when i enter it. so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. finally i call the executive class phone line (which i am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours.",no
no,"   i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... the flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. after trying to use the voucher for a new flight, ba kept advising i couldn't as the voucher had been used. i asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. two years in, i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. i then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund. one phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. i then chased when it was long overdue. i was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. the refund never came. i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this, i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now.",no
yes,"     when i tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel, but i did not have it, i tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where i had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. after a very long time, i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told i had missed the check in by 2 minutes. they would not let me board, and i missed the flight. so i contacted ba, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because i missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy. so then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. i originally paid £1500 for the flights. i then did a search on google and found flights for £1100, flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on. unfortunately ba had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document. when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and i had a lovely flight with no issues. every time i fly with ba, i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again.

yes,     another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga. this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon. then on flight the the wi-fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? really? it’s all one excuse after another with ba these days.,no

yes,"     this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing 787. overall, premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class. also, the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing 787 than in the old b747 or even than in the b777. seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. food, service and entertainment options were good. clearly worth the extra money for premium economy.",yes
no,"   british airways continues to decline in customer service. i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. the most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. even as part of the executive club (silver) i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. at this rate, they have lost my trust.",no
no,"   on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax. i saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. as i’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else. i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them. on twitter, i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. they just left my message unread. after about 6 hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it. i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not. i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. i’m not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again. i’m extremely frustrated.",no

yes,"     i booked a flight to london and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. if my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) i was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (i am 32 and not deaf). sometimes, they would purposely hang up before i said anything. other times, they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight. if i managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" in the end, ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and i booked with another airline on principle.

no,"   we are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the uk and have had all 4 flights with british airways. our 2 internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific. i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didn't realise until we checked in. i ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck. we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal.  overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect.",no
yes,     i would like to thank you for the great service. i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours. i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight.,yes
yes,"    i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. the cabin had 10 rows of seats in bc, a record for me. the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. the food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. british airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a brit.",yes
no,"   we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the 24th april 2022. check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early. overall a very pleasant trip. we will be flying again with british airways",yes
yes,"     i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. having paid almost £1k extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. there was no option to get any of the other available flights. the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move. the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. the seats were uncomfortable. food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. the poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure.

yes,"    business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account, i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling! this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.",no

yes,"     we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london. as qantas fly to heathrow, british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow. we booked this flight in october however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from british airways, advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled. to help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport, which is 26 miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh, not glasgow. not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from australia. there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways. they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again.

no,"   the service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. the food was good for airplane food. the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows",yes
yes,"     total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport. boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of air france, swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals. menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced. i wouldn't mind, but on european trips in 2022, ba are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight. crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return. ba is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

no,"   shout out to the help desk at heathrow, we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great, she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day.",yes
no,"   i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong - i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the uk, i have watched their decline with great sadness. my flight to paris was no exception. not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. as they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris. as it transpired i was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend. never again.",no
yes,"     the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer. at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the ""points game"" but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. this status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check. nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel. i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. in summary would i ever fly with ba again? no, not if i had half a chance of going with another airline. ",no
yes,"     a very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. crew was wonderful new seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. entertainment great. wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnecting. generally a positive experience.",yes
yes,"    british airways is the most terrible airline i’ve dealt with. they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. they hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. you can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again.",no

no,"   ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought i'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba8703 this monday. easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2d (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1a or c), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled. what's not to like, which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last 25 years. anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once.",yes
no,"   new club suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used. food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok. the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue. well done ba.",yes
yes,    very small plane for a busy route. service was good but food not so. ran out of a lot and options left were not good. cabin crew for ba actually really friendly.,yes
yes,"     ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn't be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraft. out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the us. ",no
yes,"     flew back on ba0254 bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class. a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. even tried to pay ba's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. my wife and i were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13e and f. good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. the march film selection so not good. not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though ba's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. london). sort it out ba. took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. my wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. as usual when ba is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. i recommend hesitatingly - come on ba, be great again. we pay a lot for ""premium"" seats.",yes
no,"   the worst budget airline i’ve ever used! far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. ba charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. they left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. it took three days to return it and cost us £100s. then on return i’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. i don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but i’ll be pursuing for compensation. i have some free flights from amex but i won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again.",no
yes,"    first, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (zrh-lhr, gva-lhr & lhr-zrh), first 2 in economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. the infrastructure however is appalling. zrh-lhr impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. gva-lhr, 2.5hrs late as no-one at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate. lhr-zrh, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! there are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10.",no
yes,"     have not flown economy with ba for years, what a shock! hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. and no antibacterial wipes offered. wi-fi advertised but not available on flight. paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to easy jet, ryanair or jetstar. my last time travelling with ba after more than 18 years of flying with them. ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be.",no
yes,"     flew to barbados 16 march on ba 255 in the new club class suite. a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. comfortable, big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. nice friendly fa's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing. took off and landed on time. smooth flight. only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. come on ba, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. i recommend with the usual caveats.",yes
no,"   very poor flight from cape town to london. after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. this was no big deal. then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming. in the event take off was permitted quite soon after. the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. the food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. the cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. no top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. time was when flying in business class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",no
no,"   our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. no snacks were offered during the flight. this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. after 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos. if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food. we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again.",no
yes,"     complete and utter chaos at heathrow, yet again. surely the ceo, sean doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. the queue for the first wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. as emerald oneworld, i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since bea/boac days.",no
no,"   feb 25, 2022. we show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. after that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. we had a connecting flight in london. when trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour. however, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. the next available flight to dublin was 2/27 late evening. with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london. after talking to a british airways manager, they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). when we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. within a few days, it's declined. we have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. we tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin, transportation to and from the airport in london, the hotel for london, the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy. there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from.",no
yes,"     british airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new club suite, but ba59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines club world product. the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. on boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. we suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of ba. frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. it's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.",no
yes,"     we flew to funchal, madeira yesterday. madeira has no covid restrictions for entry, yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes, before we could check in online. i received an ok about an hour later, but my husband did not, so i couldn’t check in online. we arrive at heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. there were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. i went to complain to various ba staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. one blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. the whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. and completely unnecessary! if we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. my husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for madeira. i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did i, even though i’d previously been told, i could check in online. also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. the flight itself was fine, on time. we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.",no

yes,"    i really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this first class. the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. the official ba lounge in singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. suffice to say it was not pleasant. onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. i had to ask for slippers. the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. i mean it’s first class, not a student house party. neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. most of the food was awful. my steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. i will say, the cheese and port were nice. however the worst thing was the constant galley noise. there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1k) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. i will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally i’m happy in club and would never do first again.",no

yes,"    one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. i last flew with ba may 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one it crisis. i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug 2018 to bologna - ba cancelled the flight. then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. fast forward to feb 26th, 2022. received a message 5.30am 30mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled. arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. the staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba. ha ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr. by some miracle the app sprung into life, and i managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. by 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. pointed out ba should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. eventually got to departures and made it through security. ba customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as ba were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. boarded flight 45mins late. sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight they purport to be a top-class airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse. the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. the aircraft are cramped and worn. i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket. how on earth can ba justify their prices? the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.",no
no,"   we will never use ba again for a long haul flight. our experience of the flight from lhr-mle wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. we weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in business/first. actually, i think ba only care about the business/first customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. they ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. we weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! ba just don’t care anymore about the little people.",no

yes,"     our flight back to athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. what's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with, and i will never be flying with them again.",no
yes,"     flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. the aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. after serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. a hot breakfast should be offered. with only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, i made staff aware. whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. it was a struggle to get my connecting flight. on arriving in glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. first time using ba premium and likely my last.",yes

yes,"    the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. sadly, ba59 makes use of the old club world product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba42/43. there are some good points about the old club world - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. the tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to ba's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. arrival was on schedule, but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.",no
yes,"     british airways continues to go downhill. we flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. we were packed in full 3x3 seats because of it issue the day before. even if weren’t, the seat pitch and width is the same as economy. gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. the food was dreadful. the in flight service was unsophisticated. ba used to have an acceptable european business class. they don’t any more. other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around 5 years ago, how i used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. covid is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful.",no

no,   another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway. so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday 19 february for operational reasons was pitiful. you could not rebook via ba’s website. instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a17 at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a17 were a disgrace.,no
yes,     check in at iad was quick and easy. lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good. sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight. flight on time and boarded promptly. as we had eaten we opted to sleep. there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it. we slept well. on time arrival and quickly made it to t5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.,yes
yes,"     very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter. telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable.",no
no,  having just booked ba for a return flight - being one hour each way in club class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. a full business class ticket and a fee for seat? a very disengaged management model.,no
yes,"     ba got everything right. allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us. on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy. in spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. good range of drinks. easy transfer to c gates. aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. pre departure drinks served. the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. the food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. on time arrival, baggage off very fast. overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done",yes
yes,     appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). they don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line. ,no
yes,"     this past november/december i flew washington-london return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante. the cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business. this was one of a number of bookings that i had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). it's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and i'm looking forward to future trips on ba.",yes
yes,"     i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline. our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. i found that booking with them was extremely simple. unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. i called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before i could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. the person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. i got the full refund on my credit card the day after. i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, i’ll definitely make sure to check with british airways first.",yes
no,"  ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. we had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. however, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl. the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again.",yes
yes,"    boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. the club suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. however, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw. the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive. the new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. overall, a good flight.",yes
yes,"     unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. the bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post ipad era just don’t live up. the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. i’m afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels.",no
no,"   utterly appalling company. we've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. the first time: return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. there was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff. there were none. eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. we had no letter. they then put us on a bus to the other terminal. when we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. we were literally just left there. we had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. when we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. we were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. eventually we got to board the next day. my tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and i didn't get a meal. no compensation was offered. the second time i need to reschedule my flight. the website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. i needed to phone up. if you need to phone ba, don't even bother trying. i never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. the food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. my sandwich was inedible. 
",no
no,  over the past 2 years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle. while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless. first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. in the end after a 12 hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone. in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york. since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. when i got a response i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing! ,no
yes,"     return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency. our outbound trip in december was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. the lounge was busy, but no complaints. we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. i checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in durban, and flown to cape town, port elizabeth, back to cape town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",yes
yes,"     i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service! firstly, i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. my flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, i arrived at the airport around 15:40. i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight. i went to ""club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault. she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully. i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. diversity; the first time i flew was in 2018 and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different.  the staff was very kind and friendly as well. what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!",yes
yes,"     i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back. given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class. from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in. when we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. needless to say it never did. finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. so i come back to the question: can big corporations lie with no accountability? why would i spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. stop your lying or update your promises!",no
yes,"     i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as i’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. i understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but ba’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. enormous queues at jfk ba check-in terminal 7. even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. at times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. the interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. very poor. i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.",no
yes,"     the entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. my food left something to be desired. two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. just overall a very basic generic airline.",no
yes,"     straightforward and friendly baggage drop. on to south lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. ordered a frittata as was so hungry. made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. however, the doors cannot close till take off. i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour. lunch came in another almost hour. asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. chocolates are lindor. nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. naive to trust claims of world class standards.",no
no,"  on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. it took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). the whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. one check-in desk for euro traveller / club europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport.",no
yes,"     in glasgow one check in desk open. huge queue with no business check in. it took me close to an hour to bagdrop. getting onto the aircraft in glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  i normally find ba cabin crew very nice. breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  i used the ba lounge in terminal 3. not very keen on the new table service. poor choice and miniscule portions. lounge staff were very nice in both directions. on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t5 to t3. we were packed in like sardines. so much for social distancing. the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. no drinks or anything offered while we waited. food was not even worth mentioning. as far as club europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa- sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba, and he was right. for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time. i've never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time. pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. on board i gave the food a miss.  heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time. food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined.  both cases were last off again. club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.",no
yes,"    after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid, it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt, and in the club suite seats (1k and 2k) to boot. these seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang cw seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the ife screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. the food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. it was good to be back!",yes
yes,"     i paid $1189 for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy. they bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me i'd be issued a refund. instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, twitter, and finally email. they told me i'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 i paid for the upgrade. instead they refunded $14.58. i emailed again and they told me i'd be getting $115.16 more back. when i emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with ""that's the final amount."" turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and i was only getting $115.16 total. so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me.",no
yes,"    very nice return flight with ba. to add to my previous review, i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. the a320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. great wifi at really competitive pricing + i think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. domestic t5 arrivals is a breeze.",yes
yes,"     overall, a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays. lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when i travelled last time). although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23c) and had a funky lighting. although seats are the same as those in economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at air france) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for gold card passengers, ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch). the crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. i am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. for a quick hop, ba ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a cdg-lhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box). one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5: the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead. it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a gold status. nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. the flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",yes
no,"   first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken. the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families? the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. the entertainment system is basic, it does not support bluetooth headphones, the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that.",no
yes,"     flying during covid is always a challenge. ba’s verifly app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. the bags drop at t5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. the cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. we were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, i arrived relaxed and unstressed.",yes
yes,"     flew to nashville via chicago in first. excellent check in and security. lounge was good. food and drink choices very good. first cabin on 787 is 8 seats. comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. cabin service top banana!! food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. a special call out to stewart tim. a credit to ba.",yes
yes,"     i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse. t5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc. ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. a320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. there is no inflight screen no overhead screen. although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba. the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. ba hang your head in shame.",no
yes,"     we've just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. the privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. the wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in covid times.",yes
yes,"     my flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather. airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back, i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app, they could not do it at the desk. i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt, then i waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.",no
yes,"     it is first time we have flown ba business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. it was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. no complaints at all in that department. food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. we were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. you cannot see out. you cannot see other passengers. it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. we were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. my wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future, if at all possible.",no
yes,"     i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. i have sent them a complaint per e-mail and i still didn't get a reply. it has been 4.5 months and i am still waiting for an answer. furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service.",no
yes,"    british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all.",no
yes,"     i have a flight booked for january 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed. my second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. what kind of answer is that? i mean i still need to fly to where i am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive. it is a very big inconvenience for me and i don't even get an apology, just cancel!",no
yes,"     i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. i'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that i'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves) - but on a new date. how wrong i was. first, i had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times. the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines i'd redeemed. they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. however, if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did, so i cut my losses and booked the flight. or at least i thought i did. the call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and cvc code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. a week later, i still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. i called up to confirm. the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. once again, i waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  on the friday before my monday flight, i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. the next day - around 48 hours before i was due to fly, i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. luckily, i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. the whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music. furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. though i've flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",no
yes,"     extremely disappointed in trip experience. i am gold mvp 100,000+ miler with alaska airlines. my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines. when speaking with alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task. i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process.  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska (as 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (delta). who does that without notifying the customer. i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was. they explained british airways had rebooked with delta. this took about 30mins with customer service. then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out. i am so frustrated.",no
yes,"     british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid. took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. in contrast, on recent air france and iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk. ",no
yes,     i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departure. there was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.,no
yes,"    check in was ok, all documents were scanned without problems. the flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m25. not the airlines fault. 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a321 neo went ahead. the club europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off. for me at 5.11 tall, i can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. the inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. the crew failed to work as a team. you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. not ba's finest hour.",no
yes,"    arrived at the south airport in tenerife 2 hours before departure, iberia had not opened the check in. even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post covid took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. not sure why. the plane was a very new a321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. the seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew.",yes
no,"   check-in very slow. no app check-in and could not check my vaccine qr code online. check in staff friendly but too few of them. ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use. boarding fine, but plane was worn out. seats close together and row 30 even worse.  crew really professional and happy it seemed. arrival at heathrow a total shambles. ba777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. then ba jetty didn’t work. then ba had no steps. very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps. everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch. so ba skimping on lounge, plane condition and gate. crew good, seats very uncomfortable.",no
yes,"     after 1h queuing at the check-in desk, i am told that my booked seat is not available. why do you sell seats that you do not have?",no
no,"   outbound, seated in row 10, i was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so i had to settle for gnocchi. the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if ba could not get a better one! on the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, i had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined). food was rigatoni with vegetables. overall, penny pinching by ba in club class. dreadful - not for us again.",no
yes,"     flew club europe london - tenerife south 5 november and returned 12 november. club europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. we did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. however, on the inbound ba had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near a320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. not a good check in experience at tenerife south - just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue. also not a great lounge - the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two. i would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become.",yes
yes,"    3 hours standing in line for boarding pass. airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically. then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight. and yes, we used verifly. my flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes. they are so unorganized and slow! getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines. you have to wait even though i paid for it. avoid this airline at all costs! absolute worst!",no
yes,"    i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now. i cant change online because i'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online. i've tried live chat several times and waited 2.5 hours only to be told there's no one available (during business hours). i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end. customer service is non existent. however, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently. shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline. i haven't had these problems at all and i've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately). it's been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i don't even speak spanish. ",no
yes,"     this whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about. would not even allow me to add tier points. the flight to london was marred with problems. in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent. this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. the resort (riu paradise beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too. the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month. now we all know this is a better option.",no
no,"   poorly mismanaged services this time. disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters, had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check in. then came the boarding, again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins. finally when we thought things are better now, on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned. around 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flight. on boarding the next flight, no space to keep the luggage. journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba.",no
no,   currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “live chat”. all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. we just wanted to be able to make a name change. absolutely impossible. their website is unusable. their customer service is a shambles. they couldn’t change the name. told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully. well you’re going to have these people making mistakes. so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. like hello it’s the 21st century. you should have a button saying “change name”. anyways not the point. the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do. then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said “thanks for your help i’ll deal with it la-“ got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. all i can say is good luck.,no
yes,    another ba shuttle flight and a good one. fantastic flying weather and i would say a 40% load factor. good professional crew. friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries. and getting to the a gates at t5 makes for an easy exit. still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.,yes
yes,"    flight from larnaca to lhr. check in was ok. the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared, it was basic but ok. flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. there were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this a321. service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. it’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if i’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it. staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. the seats are not so comfortable. not dreadful but something for ba to think about.",yes
yes,"     upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the u.k., much distress. he was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a supervisor. the check in manager, goncalo ribeiro, came to our rescue.  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day 2 test, uploading it onto our plf’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in. he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service. he was a very professional ambassador for ba!",yes
yes,"    club europe on british airways. outstanding and wonderful to have ba back. the welcome on board was warm and sincere. flight attendants helpful, friendly and professional. great updates from the flight deck. super lunch and good choice of wines. ba at its best. hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz.",yes
no,"   good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with the beautiful a10 gate at lhr t5(, so we were bussed to the plane (first time i've used a bus gate there). the a320 was at t3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at the ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages. also the seat recline on g-gatl (9f) is broken.",yes
yes,"     usual ba economy trip, pleasant crew. complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices. i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft. very cramped seating and uncomfortable. the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me. other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced. this time it was good value.",yes
yes,"     check in was easy, security quick, lounge fine. lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great). flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree. there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either. drinks were fine and proactively served. on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround. baggage off quick",yes
no,"   what has happened to british airways? the whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. on the premise it’s due to covid precautions! they are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. i’ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much i’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. in the last year i’ve booked 6 ba flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. that cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them. as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! i’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline, i’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i’ve cancelled my ba amex. i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed. who’d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option.",no
yes,"     i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review. the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. on both inward and outward journeys, i was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin. my particular thanks must go to amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways. i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, thank you so so much.",yes
yes,"     the plane was clean and air quality very good. timing was perfect. i was seated in 15 k. to begin with , i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat. when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started, i was told that tea would be served after dinner. i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened. at dinner, there was no tea service. i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea.  there was no hand soap in the washroom. however, on my way to london from toronto, my experience was a good one. however, it was not the same on my return flight.",yes
yes,     the service was excellent. the cabin staff were attentive and efficient. the food and drinks were very good. the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice. overall a very enjoyable flight.,yes
no,"   i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens. what i got was a premium economy seat. the first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (i was in row 11). this is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba mis-selling. had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, i wouldn’t have booked. i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off. apparently this is a long running scam, i don’t know how they get away with it.",no
yes,"     terrible customer service. booked my flight before covid. couldn’t go, still can’t go as borders are still closed. i wasn’t given an option just told i have to take a voucher. now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still haven’t been able to go. they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me. they are not sympathetic or understanding.  the voucher is valid for another two years, i wonder how many flights will go up by then. i wonder how many more regulations there will be. i’ve been such a good customer and feel i deserve better. ",no
yes,"    this was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. but on the return flight, it was a total mess. just two counters open for economy and one for business. there were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two ba staff were contradicting each other. it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. on board, i was not expecting great service.  seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. however, i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers.",no
yes,"    lca to lhr in club europe. quick check-in at lca with speedy passport control and security. aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. boarding by group and pushback on time. ce stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. onboard w-fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. arrival ahead of schedule. disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. overall, a flight that was typical of the post-covid standard for short-haul business class.",yes
no,"   i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday 27th august 2021 to fly to manchester airport. on arrival at heathrow to check in, the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home. however, the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds. i never received these flight vouchers. i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say i was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. i have had no response to my emails/messages. one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me. so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day. ",no
yes,"     we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative. booked and paid for club class flights. didn't receive a meal or drinks onboard, crew were so unorganised. we were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. they commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogether. the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual ""we fell short of our standards"" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service. ",no
yes,     the crew at denver airport is top notch! so impressed with their customer service. they were very patient and courteous. thank you all for being amazing.,yes
yes,     an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow. usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. some people were anxious departing the aircraft. other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch. sky cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now. ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england.,yes
no,   i’ve had to book six flights with ba recently. all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. they couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick. a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. it’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.,no
yes,     the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy. the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i can’t give you the bottle only a glass. however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out. the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria 20 mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga. we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service. breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach. i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast.,no
yes,"    such terrible service in club world. such indifference and lackadaisical attitude. hardly any service. everything has to be asked for and gotten. asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..'whaa' and then when i said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer. pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by, eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea. seriously ba...what are you doing? is this how you welcome back people to fly?",no
yes,     lhr to lca. galleries lounge chock-a-block first thing on a wednesday morning and t5 seemed as bustling as pre-pandemic. boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full. superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away. expanded club europe stretching back 12 rows - the new norm? departure on time. good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch. post-covid lunch remains restricted - do&co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish i've ever tasted. wi-fi access wasn't free for business class passengers: £4.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive. arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca.,yes
yes,"     very pleasant flight to lisbon! it was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. however, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big club class cabin. friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. what a contrast to the iberia crew (lisbon/madrid/london) who were cold and unprofessional.",yes

yes,     stranded in the lounge because i wasn't allocated a seat. this for a flight that i booked months ago. i didn't want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasn't available. i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options.,no
yes,"     i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: i purchased a round-trip business class ticket from new york to-and-from mykonos through london. i traveled there with no problem. the day before my return to new york, though, i took my covid-19 test and learned that i tested positive. i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" no ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (i did not - i bought it on ba.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london, athens or new york lines. two days later after having 2 negative pcr tests (the most accurate test), i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the u.s. i've now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing. the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. they have offered that if i send them a greek doctor's note saying that i was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york. i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.

yes,"     my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time, but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. because of this delay, i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana. i was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. when i booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. turning it into an 8 hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. i am very disappointed by this experience.",no
yes,"    year after year the british airways (ba) service on the same route (washington-london) is becoming worse. we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july 2021.  british airways (ba) notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this covid era. their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check uk.gov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results. they charged us $250 per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. ",no
yes,"     ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member. however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill. flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel. ",no
yes,"     the entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map. though the aircraft was 8 years only, the window blinds worked with delays. the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a short-haul flight. after flying with aeroflot and s7 airlines, i expected to receive an excellent ba service, but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. i think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. i can get that hot meals on board are now rare. i loved the most comfortable seats in my life! i tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time i didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff. ",yes
yes,     i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class. despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23kg each. the value for money here is incredible. the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful. the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. there was wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix. if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.,yes
yes,     very efficient evening bag drop. security quick. galleries north lounge was very good. food and drinks fine. plane left on time pre ordered door was ok. early arrival. fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early!,yes
yes,"     me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on 11 august. when we landed at heathrow, my baby was sleeping. i asked stewards for my stroller, and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building. i grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. i went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. and there was no one to ask. just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me. on top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder. i met no one whom i can ask for a help. first british airways representative i met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases.  no further assistance or help. i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram. i am absolutely frustrated, upset and disappointed! i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all.",no
yes,"     for this flight from heathrow t5, passengers were piled into the bus and left for 30 mins at the terminal.  very unhappy passengers - and when confronted the ba transport manager's response was ""sorry - we are still learning"". on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage (i helped). shame - since lounge service was very good. for the flight out from munich ba had not (re) signed up to the now open lounge in munich. to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event.",no
yes,"    ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check-in, this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this, they want to see the actual forms tests etc! this wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless. the return flight again had no access to the club lounge, you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience). on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair. on board food was very good for a short haul flight.",no

yes,"     i’ve been flying with ba for years and never had any issues. i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba. so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site. once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived. i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english. anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. so operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? around three weeks before i was due to travel, ba, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to bud again. needless to say i was furious. i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. great excuse, only having looked at bud arrivals info, ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. so ba’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. epilogue: i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba, although they refused to refund my bhd - lhr flights because who knows? i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers. given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, i’ve decided to avoid ba from now on.",no

no,"   the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in london, and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover. that's before i board the flight to toronto. while i understand schedule changes, and do my best to stay positive and supportive, i contacted the airline, asking for upgrades to a best seat. i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport. they denied my ask, no explanations and no empathy. not only that, but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation. again, not the change in schedule, not the extra 5 hours layover time. just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute. ",no
no,"   i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets. but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass, they assigned 11h and 5d. called several times but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available. when we boarded, the whole plane was empty and still they didn't allow us to seat together. ",yes
yes,"     i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. note that ba actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 uk pounds in this case! does any other airline in the world dare do that? i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. the seats were ba's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- i wonder why? no preflight drink was offered. at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. the ""bed"" is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. the amenity kit is the smallest i've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. all in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that ba charges for this route. i used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with ba's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",no
no,"   aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present. it was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in club europe, the flight took off ahead of time. service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the covid effect, presumably. arrival into t5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing.",yes

yes,"    after sixteen months of being grounded by covid, it felt almost surreal to be back in t5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece. t5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnson’s bully boy attitude. ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. the flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in club europe. boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’. service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual do&co quality. landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form. overall, a thoroughly reassuring, coming out of covid, experience.",yes
yes,"    ba cancelled flight in dec 2020. refund was promised in voucher form by call center. we are now 6 months down the line, 13 calls of which each is 40 min waiting time, and 16 email reminders. conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher. head of call center is keeping to her empty promises.",no
yes,    fantastic flight down to heathrow. crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times. nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water. it’s a start.,yes
yes,"     boarding and disembarking were greatly organised: passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows, from the backside to the front (business), minimizing the possiblity for jamming. same at disembarking: passengers were asked to remain seated, then row per row was called. crew members were supporting the process. what could be improved: distribute hand-sanitizer during boarding. when snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it, this was my first flight since one year, and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba - still it left some strange experience.",yes
yes,"    this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments. i was happy with the fast baggage check-in. this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline. the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be, particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance. there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable - i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i don't expect such at this level. bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome. the plane arrived 10 minutes late.",yes
yes,     ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight. after having my return cancelled 3 times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route. i had not been informed before requesting the “e-voucher” and i would need to call up to rebook (i’m in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion). so not only was my flight cancelled 3 times i wasn’t offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way.,no
yes,"    absolutely appalling experience. british airways, unfortunately, has lowered it's standards and to my dismay, i've been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba. customer service representatives are completely clueless, unprofessional and not bothered.  i recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren't interested in helping me return home.",no
yes,"    had booked the above mentioned flight. but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates. the airline didn’t notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for check-in. it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn't realise i was flying from canada to india via london. the restrictions didn't allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones. when i booked a single ticket from canada to india, how come they didn't realise i couldn't fly? no refund at all. gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but i don't have any travel plans for the next two years. that means my money is gone? when talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'onetravel'. the worst experience ever with an airline. am a frequent flyer, was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you. on my return journey, the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to take me. a poor show with ba.",no
yes,"     my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled 2 times. when i call to ba several times their computer system didn’t work and they couldn’t issue new ticket, as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage, as i couldn’t pay online without ticket. they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay, food and travel if complete online form. when i done it, i was asked to submit expenses, but link provided was to lost baggage expenses, not what i claimed. i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link. they replied that they wouldn’t compensate anything.

no,"   i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip. fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment. firstly - no lounge at all at mexico city terminal 2. there's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. mexico city terminal 1 has functional lounges for aeromexico working. not good enough for an expensive ticket. finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time. so for an 11 hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps. the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. the seat would not easily convert to a bed. it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this. despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found. ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. given that i told them specifically where i'd left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. all in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. ba isn't offering it at the moment. if it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. the company just don't care.",no
no,   charge £700 fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance. absolutely disgraceful. their site says £30 fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page 27 of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount.  i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative.,no
no,"   good service the whole way. nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight. plane was clean and refreshments were provided. my only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic, even with the masks? my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! also wi-fi did not work. i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic i'm sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive! to be expected though, i know.",yes
no,"   i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers, when she realized that i was going to my mother's funeral with the flowers she was apologetic (she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers) but the crew were very nice to me during this flight.",yes
yes,"     i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow. but because russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and i couldn’t get home. i’ve also tried to fly through antalya, but the same situation occurred. on my third try, i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo. i was declined by another company. then i went to british airways. starting from testing (because egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (i’m not sure is it connected to ba, but still, i want to mention this). the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this. i want to separately point out one employee - shanell (if i am not mistaken, who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5). she is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! carrying on, i went to ba check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. however, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to cairo, the situation became even more complicated (i will spare the details). however, here again, brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. the nicest lady i’ve ever met, unfortunately, i didn’t catch her name, but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough. she also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  lastly, the nice lady (shame i don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position. he was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways i can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. to conclude, i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them. i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality, but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! for some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. however, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. as no one in",yes

no,"   overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service 10/10. everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. they have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. the one thing - which i mean as constructive criticism though - i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice. that's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day i travelled. overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received.",yes
yes,"    i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munich-london city-munich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day. friendly, professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe ba, while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant, impossible to contact and ignorant. well done and best wishes to all at british airways.",yes

yes,"     i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! as this was my 100th flight, i decided to celebrate it in club europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. efficient business class check in at warsaw, cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for club europe because of corona). the aircraft was very fresh and clean. seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. the on board service is different than before corona times but it’s still very good. tasty lunch box from do&co with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. the choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte. all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways. everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled. the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow. we waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority.",yes

yes,"     my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris 3'25"" late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris. i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the 3-hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this. after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences. they claim i traveled on af65 and arrived in london ahead of schedule. the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge. so, ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there. i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history.",no
yes,"     i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. the plane to london was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given covid, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. an upgrade for 89 euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense. at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean.",no

yes,"     i flew with ba recently from sydney to london, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong. after booking, hk closed it's borders so i could no longer get this flight. i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call. i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didn't want to end up stuck in australia. i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice. when i got back home i raised this with ba. they told me that i was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! i'd never even heard that term before. he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say i had to do anything. so now because i was given the incorrect advice, i am out of pocket by a considerable amount. i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so. they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. when i said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.  i will never use this airline again.",no

yes,"     i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother. the second leg, from singapore to london was with british airways. my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways, leaving 23 february. on 20 february it became clear that mum did not have long to live. i contacted ba, who said i should be able to change my return date, and asked me to send medical documentation, which i did, with an explanatory email. sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 february. i contacted ba again the next day. they said because i had booked through webjet, i needed to contact them. i phoned them, they said they would contact ba. no follow up from either. when i phoned webjet again, they said still no word from ba. when i phoned ba again, they said they couldn't help. at this point i gave up and booked with qantas, paying for another flight. ba's complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded me. needless to say, i will never use british airways again.",no

yes,"     vancouver to london. there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers. this flight proves the point. from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr, the crew were outstanding. friendly, attentive and professional. the dinner was excellent. excellent choices on the menu, accompanied by some decent wines. i had a painful back from running. a flight attendant provided some medication, came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned. very thoughtful. seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket. ife good. the b747-400 is showing its age but it’s still a wonderful, iconic aircraft to fly on and i’ll continue to prefer it over the b777.

yes,"     i am flying london to seattle in business class in may 2020, and british airways wants around £100 each way for me to choose seats. all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. they decided to change my seat ""for operational reasons""s. what could that reason be? the plane is the same. so, ba takes £100 off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat - without asking me. what i get is an automated message (the next time i log on to the ba website) to tell me. there is a number i can ring, 40 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up. ",no
yes,"     london heathrow to nairobi. ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines, i despair. the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t3. to cram 14 first-class seats onto a 777 is quite an achievement. but it is the food that is the standout problem on board. it is poor and it is shameful that our flag-carrier represents britain so badly in this regards. conversely, the flight attendants were excellent in both directions. i only flew first because ba's business class is so poor. but never again.",no
yes,"     dubai to london. my husband and i traveled together. he got business class, my ticket was a last minute add-on, so was premium economy instead. after we boarded, my husband came to me to give me his pillow, so i got settled and started sleeping. i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that, there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow, did i take the pillow. i told her i didn’t, and the pillow was given to me. i stood up and told her it wasn’t ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow, and i’ll show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow. i located my husband in the business class, apparently, his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one. he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it.",no

yes,"     las vegas to paris via london. the staff were great, but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class i’ve experienced.  the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle, a business class configuration of 2-4-2. that’s a tight squeeze. and,there were backward facing seats. the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration. i was just glad i didn’t pay full price for this flight.",no

yes,"     mexico city to manchester via london. my plane from mexico city to london was smooth. entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn't actually the window, but a wall! the crew was amazingly kind and lovely. they're always checking on you, and we even got a magnum! loved this airline for my first flight ever.",yes
yes,"    london heathrow to sofia. a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a321 cabins, although unfortunately without any in-seat power supply, contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in-seat power following refresh. another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product. however the flight overall was very good. as usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at heathrow's excellent t5. fast track security was fast, as expected. galleries club lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight. the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering. i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11"" chap. so overall a good experience with no major complaints.",yes

yes,"     madrid to london. i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. this a321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall club europe is not worth the money - don't waste your money on this.  ",no
yes,"     prague to london. this is the first time i have flown with british airways. the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about 5 minutes early. however at heathrow, there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. a negative was at the check-in, partly the website’s fault, as we had done the online check in. we selected the amount of bags we each had. it said we would have to pay extra, and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each bag. apart from those negatives and the delay, i would definitely fly this airline again.",yes
yes,"     johannesburg to london. whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. thankfully, the upper deck of the a380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. food was mediocre and i've given up expecting anything more from ba's business class product. the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. reliability is currently ba's strongest card.",yes
yes,"     las vegas to gatwick. a very disappointing service for club world, it felt like i was travelling in economy (with attitude). especially considering the very high cost of the flight (i've paid half as much less for business class returns to australia). we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered, when i queried it, i got a lecture on this was how it should be. no wine arrived with dinner, until i asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. yes, i could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask. the good news is the food was good and well presented. although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). we had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, i actually thought i had a fever (i was so drenched in sweat) until i spoke to a colleague who was the same. i'm used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines, so i'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. i do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement. the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. really ba, you need to do much, much better. the ground staff in las vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. the lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",no
yes,"     san diego to stockholm via london. had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. but i realise this would be unfair- ba is a game of two halves. the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. the food in club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine. the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers. the problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. in my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. then a comedy of errors. first the hotel vouchers just said ‘holiday inn’. there are about 15 in san diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. next, the replacement flights. the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights. but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. on calling ba they wouldn’t talk to me because i ‘failed’ security- i didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. the next day i went to take the replacement flights- alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm. despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, i was pulled off minutes before takeoff. ba had not paid for the flight! a reservation had been created but no ticket issued. ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was i not on this? when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after i complained about all of the above. finally, i arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. in summary, when all goes well, ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. but old planes, rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. and bear in mind i was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",no
no,"   cape town to johannesburg. the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink, including ingenious wine-dispensing machines. boarding was quick and take-off was exactly on time. there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed. the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray. arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule.",yes
yes,"    on 4th of december before my flight's departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it. thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport. when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i haven't had any food for the whole day as i didn't have any money. i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely. i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff! once again thank you!",yes
yes,"     phoenix to london. since moving to the usa i've been flying ba more than in the past and overall, they provide a more than acceptable service. if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations. the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good. departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes. if you manage your expectations with ba, then you won't be disappointed with club world.",yes
yes,"    london heathrow to bangkok. done this route a few times with british airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment system. uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight. i know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away. the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy.",no
yes,"     mumbai to boston via london. my flight with british airways was really good. the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. however, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you. also, ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. they have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston. also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston 24 hrs after i had come. even after contacting ba's baggage customer service, they were speaking rudely to me. they always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern. british airways needs to improve their ground experience.

yes,"     toronto to geneva via london. i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. apparently things have improved somewhat since, so i decided to give them another try. overall, i was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". pilots were very good and informative, as always with ba. quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. the ife was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. cathay pacific's is far superior. the two major downsides: 1. the new basic economy fare. it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. ba really need to get rid of it. virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. if i wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, i'd fly to gatwick on a charter airline. also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely. 2. no complimentary catering on short-haul. seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with ba and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. if ba would get rid of these two new features, i would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. as it is, i would still consider other airlines.",yes
yes,"    hong kong to london heathrow with british airways. one of the best flights i’ve had in a premium cabin. the service, seat, food and wine are among the best i’ve experienced. the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba. the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch. i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight.",yes
yes,"     san jose to amsterdam via london. layout of boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins (row 42-44 d, e, and f,). in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats (row 42-43 k, j) with their bags and blankets. i would not recommend ba or the 787.",no
yes,"     singapore to paris via london. the flight was a ok, dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience. however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with ba and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in paris will be spent without luggage.",no
yes,"     warsaw to london. everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight. professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in a321neo, as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in ba's executive club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at warsaw airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.",yes

no,"   london to los angeles. take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. i was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. and we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. sorry they said. during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. to cap it off, we landed at 10pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. we finally received them back 2 days later. conclusion, never fly ba again.",no
no,"   british airways (comair) johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed, and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back 9 rows. service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, i.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges. comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering. aside from the meal, the flight was typically efficient, with arrival slightly ahead of schedule.",yes
yes,"     london to bangkok. it's not what it used to be but most importantly, it does not deliver what it promises any longer.  disappointing food, outdated and uncomfortable seats, appalling baggage handling at lhr, and  mediocre crew service onboard. the customer service online is just as bad. my most recent experience was early january 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk. baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. the couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. however, my dealings with customer service was appalling. when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep?",no

yes,"     overall a very comfortable flight with british airways. both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing 777-200 to a boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. on my second flight to mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. however, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. overall, my both flights with ba were good. there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports, power outlet, old ife, the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom.  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing 777-200 and boeing 747,if they still plan to use them on longer flights.",yes

yes,"     gatwick to tirana. i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . the seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. flight left on time and landed early. british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight w-fi service. for 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream youtube videos. they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.",yes

no,"   los angeles to london heathrow. if i could give ba a zero stars i would. they have the worst customer service. i’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family, but surely we will never fly with british airways again. they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. the flight to london didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class i’ve flown. the check-in process at heathrow was disastrous. the most inefficient process with no human assistances. the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers. i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier. i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them.",no
yes,"     istanbul to london. we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in. we had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up. once they did, the staff were surly and rude. on the flight and there was no ife, no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight. the onboard crew were a bit chaotic. serving m&s food for purchase. the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth. however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic. ",no
yes,"     london to bucharest. on my flight the hot food finished half way through - i was seated on row 22 and by the time the food cart reached my row, there were no sandwiches left to purchase. the fitting of the cabin was horrendous. seat change from one row to the other 24h before take off cost me an additional 13 gbp. ",no
yes,"     london heathrow to rio de janeiro. not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites, this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world. flight not full, seated in 7f aisle seat, no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. it is away from the toilet over at 7a/b but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight. food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much. i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold! arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow, they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didn't really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate. all in all another very good flight.",yes
yes,"     london to athens. the aircraft and the flight quality were good, but they don't provide free food and drink. it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling, so it ended quickly.",no
yes,"     copenhagen to london. super slow, had to wait for buses which were delayed. also packed the buses to tight with people. where too far from arrival terminals. service bad from staff. coming to terminal 5 is the worst terminal on heathrow. the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price. for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.",no
yes,"     budapest to billund return via london on 18 and 28 dec. 2019. a320 aircrafts. check-in in budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues. i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer (hold a gold card with qatar airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage. i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr. there is no oneworld  lounge in budapest, so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways. for ba i do not have status. in london granted access to any oneworld lounge. onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. flights were full, but on time. i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive. luggage delivered perfectly. return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t3 in london. loads of good, hot foods and good beers and wines. onboard there is no ife, no seat recline. mediocre, not cheap. but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding.",yes
no,   i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels. it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off. the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board. which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights.,yes

yes,"     hong kong to london. i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba, provided travel document details they required. however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didn't match her passport name. they refused to let her fly, after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa, they enable her to fly. however, once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan. igot in contact with bas' executive phone helpline service, yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things. we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on. ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket. they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand. they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her. they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her.",no
yes,"     my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august. when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags, was charged 4 times for one bag after i was assured charges didn't go through. have been trying to get a refund from ba since. they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone! they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged 4 times for one bag. only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didn't owe me any money. they force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 usd and refuse to give me my money at this point. ",no
yes,"     new york to london. i was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  the boeing 777 certainly showed its age. ife screen was tiny, seat was well used. the flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me. the f& b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier. i'm a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me. its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two). ",no
yes,"     austin to london. along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter, ba charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together. when they went to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit in different seats. back home, i applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them. i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made, but there is no process to upload those documents to ba.",no
no,   frankfurt to london with british airways. awful airline. put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together. gave me middle seat even though many others were free. a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you don't book biz class. avoid.,no

yes,"    london to san francisco. this flight was a delight. friendly, relaxed crew, good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty. if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldn't be disappointed. yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably - ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of ""world's favourite airline"". the 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger services, you should take the opportunity to fly one before they're gone. i'm gradually regaining my confidence in ba.",yes
no,   heathrow to belfast. great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t5 at heathrow. very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases. totally disgusted. cabin crew were lovely on the 12.40 flight to belfast on 9th december.,no
no,"   london to singapore. i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews. i was however, surprised. firstly, they are not on part with sq or qr - but to be fair, i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. you get what you pay for. the seat while old, is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. the window seats are best for privacy. i am tall and had no issues sleeping. in fact, i slept for almost 7 hours. the service and food out of london was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas. service was consistent, polite and very attentive. drinks and water continually topped up. i was truly impressed the return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives!",yes
yes,"    toulouse to london. i'm a able bodied, fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat. i'd put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions. a cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly. i told him i could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order. after i begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had! i then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job. i wrote in to british airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respond. awful, rude airline.",no
yes,     london heathrow to stockholm. business class short-haul is what it is. seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat. but you get served drinks and food. proper gin for the g&t and good food.,yes
yes,"     johannesburg to london. we had limited recline seats on an 11 hour overnight flight. at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats. completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok, how come their representatives are allowed to lie. never flying ba again.",no
yes,"     johannesburg to london. the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it. there's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. the predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. the food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. the cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. overall, a good flight despite the aged club world product.",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to miami. flying the boeing 747-400. unfortunately ba hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft. seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small. and since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. these seats are business class on for example qatar airways. and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi! but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful. meals are impeccable.",yes
yes,     stockholm to london heathrow. as always ba works excellent with service. on the ground and in the air. they still have a good gin aboard for a decent g&t and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great.,yes
no,"  london to sydney via singapore. flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. meals were great. leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at 18:00 we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. at singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. when re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. we were on the ground in singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable. we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over 6ft tall.",yes
yes,"    london to new york jfk. we were booked on brussels airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba. the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal 5 were utter nightmares. never again will i go to or through heathrow. however, this review is about ba's 747-400 to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. how does ba have the gall to call its service ""business class""? the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. aside from that, i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. never again.",no
yes,"     the first thing is the shortage of staff. the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. at the end of the flight i discovered the switch. despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. i had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack. i am not a big eater but i was peckish. the layout of the business cabin is cramped. i am 6' and i could not stretch out. the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. this means no one has a easy seat. you either have to climb or be climbed over. i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use. the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. unfortunately, upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didn't get any better. after one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.

yes,"     brussels to bangkok via london. club world from london to bangkok on 17 nov 2019, seats 15c and 15d. it was a boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. the seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. the food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. the food was disappointing, i had smoked salmon as a starter, and british beef as main course. my soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. the service is very friendly, but not personal. i’m used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class.  while serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. after dinner i went to sleep. the seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. the space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. i had a real good night of sleep though. if your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. the toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. when i woke up, breakfast service was running.  the breakfast is good.  yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full english breakfast. overall, british airways world club is a rather standard business class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  if ba wants to compete, they have a long way to go. i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight.",no
yes,"     san francisco to oslo via london. the head support was damaged, so i had to sit 10 hours leaned forward. the flight from san francisco was delayed, so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo. i came first to the ba counter, but received a new flight 3 hours 15 minutes later. rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 gbp.

yes,"     i had a connection flight from london to berlin, traveling with hand luggage. i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage.  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass. if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage. the flight arrived in berlin 7 minutes late.",no
no,"   london to johannesburg with british airways. ba’s b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal. it’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the c gates where the a380s depart from. the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. the club world were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films. the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. breakfast was adequate but nothing more. landing was exactly on time. overall, a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average.",yes
yes,     london to bangalore. the flight from bangalore to london on 10 november 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight. my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by 1.5 hrs. we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance. ,no

yes,"     lisbon to london. i pay extra to check my bag, to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space. to have british airways charge me 50 euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult. will never fly ba again.",no
no,"   ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow, its a busy route and i'm sure make money plus there is no competition. however, ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location. because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence i'm very disappointed with the service they provide.",no
yes,"     doha to london. surprisingly good flight, ontime departure and early arrival by 30min, very very attentive and friendly crew, especially towards children. food was halal since from doha, clearly announced to passengers. bag arrival was ok. seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation.",yes
yes,"     london to buenos aires. we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight. firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. the plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. the entertainment system was pathetic. not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. the drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings.",no
yes,"     san francisco to london. a380 is a wonderful aeroplane. movie selection was below average. staff were polite. fist time i used the call button mid-flight response was fast, but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes. i don’t see how that is acceptable.",no
yes,"    sydney to singapore with british airways. packed in like sardines in a tin can. what a disappointment of an airline. they pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze. my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways). would not and could not recommended this airline. these seats are at best premium economy.",no
yes,"    london to mauritius. we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. without a shadow of a doubt, the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline.",no

yes,"     london to vancouver. i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. i flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. food service was very poor in most aspects. i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. i had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.this then put me out of sync with the service. the one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. on a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. i had become so accustomed to a normal/newish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place. the screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad. on this or similar routes i have flown air canada, westjet, virgin atlantic, air transat. ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in 2019. i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul.",no
yes,"    the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a ""mix up"" with paperwork. disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge allocation. so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. we missed our connecting flight. the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. all of this inconvenience is due to ba’s incompetent management. my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. the flight attendants are rude. it used to be a good airline.",no
yes,    london heathrow to lisbon. mediocre. the flight was very smooth and arrived on time. cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions. no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered. not a great club europe experience.,no

yes,"    tirana to london gatwick. i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while i almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. we boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. while the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wi-fi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe. in fact, the wi-fi package i got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. something that british airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as i am 1.88 cm tall. also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast, but i managed well. the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. i always recommend ba - and will continue to do so.",yes

yes,"     london to singapore. i have to commend ba staff on this occasion. they were friendly, welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight. even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us. highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness. thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one. ",yes
yes,"     london to san francisco return in economy. the seats are small. outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible. i'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. i flew on a 747 both ways. they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. i had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. i was literally sweating. economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class. asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better. i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. it's not worth it.",no

yes,"     seychelles to london. day time flight back to london. staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 j/k, best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle. on-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on. seat and screens worked great and no problems. i loved every minute of the flight. a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic. looking forward to my next flight to rio in december",yes
yes,"    london to belfast. british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace. my mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service. instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. on arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. my father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘geneva convention’ that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted. waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. at no stage did they receive any apologetic words. for someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. i will await bas response to my parents; i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. will update! in summary, don’t trust ba with your loved ones care.",no
yes,"     london to cape town. we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa. i usually fly star alliance, but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town. this was a huge mistake. i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so. then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. ba’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. we asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us. they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, i will not be booking flights on ba again.",no
yes,"     san jose to london. the tv screen of 12f was broken, could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies. flight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in. the back of the seat in front was dirty. the tray on the 12d where i was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch. although my husband in 12e and me turned in the breakfast cards together, the flight attendant insisted they don’t have it, and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast.  flight attendants were doing their best, but it seems that they were understaffed.",no
yes,"    london heathrow to edinburgh. boarding efficient. flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage. by doing so they would get priority boarding. i took up the offer, too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane. the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane - 36 f. i am sure ryanair have more room. british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy.",yes
yes,     flight from gatwick to barbados. check in and business lounge were good. it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive. breakfast was good. flight left on time boarding well run. i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok. new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems. food was fine and service friendly.,yes
yes,"     we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow. we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick. the flight was quite good. service was fantastic, and the chicken tikka masala was tasty. the crew onboard was friendly, flight was on time, and landing was amazingly smooth.",yes
yes,"     i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag. i arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait",no
no,"   zurich to london return. both legs travelled with hand luggage only, and i could not choose a seat without paying. fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least. hand luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink.",no
yes,     san francisco to london. efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at $760 per person which we declined. refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks. boarding on time but could have been better controlled. flight left and landed ahead of schedule. flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints.,yes
yes,    london to belfast. check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal-5 first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge. great selection of food and drinks early morning. i really like the ba boarding process i.e.by group numbers. the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent. overall very happy with this short flight with ba.,yes
no,"   london gatwick to salzburg with british airways. worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action, no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told it's not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home.",no
yes,"     frankfurt to london. flight attendants very kind when flying in. return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking, hotel voucher and transportation arranged. that could be done far more efficiently. no water, nothing, no necessities.",no
yes,"     hyderabad to san francisco via london. i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways. i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia. she not only helped gather all details (bank, address etc) required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly. that was certainly over and beyond what i expected. great job! your service is exemplary.",no
yes,"     vancouver to london. very poor experience my flight with ba. the 2-4-2 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class. one toilet closed (nobody around to repair ?). on one point ba even better than asian companies. its even more freezing. why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip ? no staff to answer my question. no staff to make it better. one good point, the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better.",no
yes,"    london to malaga. a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. at the checking at gatwick airport, i was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from malaga. sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. at gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk, he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. at the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. we boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. stiff and no recliner seats. cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price.",no
yes,     brussels to london. we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation. everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about 50% were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on. extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators. ,no
yes,"     my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced. the seat was uncomfortable, the flight tracker failed after two hours, the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore (scrambled egg) was like rubber. they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee, tea or drink with our breakfast. i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes. eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back. i never saw the crew member again. ",no
yes,"     kuala lumpur to glasgow via london. the service started, first some drinks. on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant.  i asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for. i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. the male attendant said “like an ipa”, i answered “yes”.  i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken, i chose amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer. the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager. the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that. abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee (even decaf), i accepted, but there was no milk or cream for me.",no
yes,"    london heathrow to seychelles. really great flight, boarding was very quick, the flight was full, seats great 07 a/b good inflight entertainment, plenty of choices. food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals, my beef was well done just how i like it. after a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into seychelles, the crew were very attentive, lots of very demanding passengers. all in all, a good flight after 7 hours of sleep",yes
yes,"     edinburgh to london heathrow. i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying, everything on the plane was fine. after the flight landed, i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it. even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. the baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which i missed. turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. hoping that british airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand. it ended up costing my wife and i almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher. we will never use this airline again.",no
no,"  amman to london. this is a nice aircraft, with comfortable seats, and a very soft landing. this aircraft flies from amman airport at 8 am local time and arrives in only 5 hours to london. this is a very good product.",yes
yes,    london to athens. british airways is a glorified budget airline. a 3.5-hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided. ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price. an m&s inflated price sandwich is the 'meal'. no entertainment options either. no usb charging on the seat as well. any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019. yet they charged full-service airline prices. so there is a mismatch. flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided.,no
no,"   terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy. this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown. and i travel a lot. the flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort. the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. if the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. shameful. the food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food. i will never fly british airways again. 0 stars. beware. i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam. horrible excuse for an airline.",no
yes,"     buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn. the aircraft is very old, cabin configuration is very old and tired. ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed. my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. before taking off in buenos aires, some pax, but not all, were offered water or orange juice. i never got any. after take off, drinks were offered, followed by a hot meal. food choices ran out in the first row. seats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammed. on the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. crew ok. no indication as to which toilets to use, either forward in business class or rear economy. having flown norwegian on their b787 in their premium cabin on the same route, ba is a waste of my money. ",no
yes,"    mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow. the b787 is an incredible plane. the legroom is quite good, the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies, series and music. the food is average, the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes, salad and wine. not very tasty. the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fruit and a muffin, it was delicious! the cabin crew was ok. not bad, not excellent. we arrived on time and was a great flight. on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice. no ife, no onboard service. it’s almost like a low cost. i recommend for long flights, but not for european flights.",yes
yes,"    great all round. ba2591, 11 october. good price, easy boarding, lovely cabin crew, great iced coffee on sale. comfortable, on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing. couldn’t ask for more (until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich).",yes
yes,"    flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus. the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort, i got no sleep. a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tasteless. not much interaction with the crew, but they seemed friendly enough. would not travel with british airways in this cabin again, really not worth the price tag.",no
no,"  flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi. honestly, they were really good, legroom great, crew excellent - looked after us superbly, food and drinks were bang on, did vegas in april too, nowt wrong with this airline.",yes
yes,"     johannesburg to amsterdam via london. after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. the following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same ""technical"" fault reported 24 hours previously. finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam. we also had to pay for our ""no show"" at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? arrived in amsterdam 30 hours later. what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.",no
yes,"    dubai to london heathrow. i flew on the a350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class (and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b777) on overnight trips. the new ""business suite"" offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced. i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. the bed was very comfortable. food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i don't know, but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite. downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.",yes
yes,    istanbul to new york via london. literally the worst experience. we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time! they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch!,no
yes,"     yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm. when i rang ba in london, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. while waiting to get off the plane, i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant. i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so. we have booked our flight with ba next year. thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service.",yes
yes,"    flight from london to athens with british airways, was one of the worst experiences. the ""new"" slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain. the screens with flight info have gone, no frills, and airline has become a bad quality budget airline. sad. avoid.",no
no,   short 45 minute flight north and south with british airways. lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats. gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits. the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time.,yes
no,"   calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways. staff are very friendly and helpful. entertainment was good. food was just ok, although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn't be my first choice to serve. the seats are incredibly uncomfortable. super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours. for a 9 hour flight this is painful. paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on. recommend for short trips.",yes
yes,"     for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to it’s poor past reputation. yesterday i traveled on ba 34 from kuala lumpur to london heathrow, i boarded the flight with an open mind, over 12 hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it’s customers. a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed, the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content, the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler. what more can i say? enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again!",yes
yes,"     austin to london. another pleasant flight on an ageing 747. after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat, meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger, she kindly swapped seats so we could be together. for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel you’re in your own little world. a good flight, on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect.",yes
yes,     london to kuala lumpur. better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews. the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg (less so on the return). a few areas need improvement: 1) separate toilets from economy 2) dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service. 3) a better 2nd meal - the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal (breakfast) was a bit of an afterthought. would i choose ba premium eco again : yes definitely.,yes
no,"  i wish i could give a zero. i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london. i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is 1 hr. my flight layover in london was 1hr5min. british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same, but that was a total lie. my wife and i were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. we had the same route in the reverse direction. i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than london’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced. ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something. i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well. be warned. stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise.",no
no,   one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children. ba don’t tell you there is no lounge at kos airport. limited seating. very noisy limited facilities. not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities. it doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour!,no
no,"   gatwick to alicante. on my outbound flight (23 sept) i gave ba almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete. on my return flight (26 sept) it was a different matter. from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the vip lounge which was good). travelling club europe had no advantages. only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to print boarding passes. when invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane. the iberia factor. honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company. once on the plane everything went like clockwork.",yes
yes,"     vancouver to london. great flight on the superb a380; in my opinion, the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment. outstanding in flight service from the crew. attentive, polite and professional; the very best of british airways service. food well above average for this cabin - though breakfast could have been better. ife excellent. the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent, plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket. very enjoyable flight. highly recommended.",yes
yes,     gatwick to alicante. 3.5 hours (1 hour sitting on tarmac) with my knees rammed against seat in front. no room to move. i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months - vueling airlines has best seats! stay away from the rest unless you are under 5ft tall!,no
no,"  we have had some torrid experiences with ba - which we have not been shy to report. so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. cheerful, efficient and calm. what more could you ask? the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. i literally cannot think of any real negatives. the luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. sadly, the current ceo doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. as we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the states, will testify! it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way. get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct. fantastic.",yes
yes,"    london heathrow to austin with british airways. it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to austin. but, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time. it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you, and always with a smile. we arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers. but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that.",yes
no,"   i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. i then cancelled my ba flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 i had paid. the £28 difference was picking my seats. how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the £28. i never received the refund. ",no
yes,"    the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than ba. as it was, weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. once airborne in a refitted a320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. it was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. a big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was wifi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. however, ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. so, not too bad, all in all.",yes
no,"  chicago to zurich via london. delays after delays. the flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (chicago time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. finally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the a380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served. during the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. in the end, the plane took off at 12 am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at 2 pm. we had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. we arrived in zurich on an old a319 at 9:30 pm zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm. very stressful at least the staff were nice.",no
yes,"    glasgow to london. smooth flight, departure/arrival on time. boarding was quick, the seat was ok. although i had pre-ordered a vegetarian option, the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. the food was good, and the wine (french, bourgogne) also surprisingly good. flight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detail. all in all, a great flight.",yes
yes,"    having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before, i was apprehensive as to how it would operate. the check-in and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes. personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not 100% confident that i did everything correctly. boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. again i'm not a fan of this. possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large a321. boarding was however smooth. on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (i'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin (believe 2 in club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not ba's fault.",yes
yes,"     i wouldn't even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via on business. 1 bag lost in transit. ground crew in mxp rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the uk, despite ba website showing in transit lhr/mxp for 8 days! numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! after an email to their ceo & director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering £100 e-voucher. abysmal customer services. no wonder their reputation is in tatters. i will never fly ba again.",no
yes,    flying london city to geneva. the only plus was the embraer e190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat. other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline. yet it charges 'full service' prices!,no
yes,"     los angeles to istanbul via london. flight between london and istanbul is like coach, no tv and small leg room. transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed. food was below average. the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped, tasteless, dirty lounge . it took us 25 min to find two chairs to seat. food was  awful and service is even worst. when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of $500 plus fee change, so we ended up paying $800 per person in addition to the fare already paid.

no,"   london to kefalonia . the t5 galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at 9:30 on a saturday. boarding was by the now standard groups, which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge. the flight deck then informed us that we’d be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot. once in the air, cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience, which was mediocre at best. fortunately, arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport 30 minutes later. overall, a typical ba experience that’s lacklustre at best.",no
yes,"     london to dublin. it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again. i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin, but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago. unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin. i was put on a flight to london instead, which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. i then flew with british airways from london to dublin. i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba, which i did. i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin. using american’s baggage tracking system, i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday. i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. ba’s customer service is terrible. if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, i am going to lose it! my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city i’m in for more than a day and i can’t get it. talk about serious frustration. i don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when i called american, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning. i did not receive that level of service from ba. i even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? i am not thrilled with either airline, but at least american has made some attempt to help me. this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years. if you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with ba. and here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. you will get a lot more information and assistance that way.

yes,"     hong kong to london. an email on the 25th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare. then the email at 6.00pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled. all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class. arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??). we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge. a broken screen in seat 59a (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him. a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight. cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. first class out to hk was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. the plane was tired, ife faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. the night term pantry offering was a total joke. i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level. certainly not value for money, we did not get a club class experience on the flight home.",no

yes,"    london to abuja-flight full, aircraft an older version of 777-200. evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja. return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos - and had to be flown back to abuja with a 2 hour delay. flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight. the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane - they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat. flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled. breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow. full credit to the crew - cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc. the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the ""floor"" was visible.",no
yes,     london to bangkok. what an awful plane. seats are just about ok going. coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat. really uncomfortable. the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed. the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films. rubbish. took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work. the plane looks old and tired. not a pleasure to travel on this plane.,no

no,"   orlando to gatwick. travelling home was extremely disappointing. the aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. only one drinks run was made. the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. i hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service.",no
yes,"     london to abu dhabi. this is the daytime flight from london. a very good flight. the food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service). the children’s meals were excellent. the entertainment system was great with a good selection. it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (etihad, why don’t you do this?). the cabin crew were good. economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad.",yes
yes,"     london to st petersburgh. huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes. seat pitch has been reduced to 30"" over the last years (from 34"") at the expense of passenger comfort. seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat. food for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungry. out of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option. avoid club europe, not worth the money.",no
yes,"     sydney to london via singapore with british airways. i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, i am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. the latter i took one bite and couldn't continue. i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. the seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. on the plus side, i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. reasonable price and speed.",no
no,"   london to johannesburg. british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. but in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. with that said in 2018, my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october, specifically 10/31. yes, that's the day called for brexit. only we made our reservations before those dates were set. considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019, coupled with brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. the good news is close to $800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage. the bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. i was just not feeling the love here! so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways. all of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. instead of ba, we changed our booking to 10/30 on etihad airways through abu dhabi. their customer service was outstanding. the fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other. i am entering travel in september 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.",no
yes,"    i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money. the food was no better than economy food from the past. the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. this might be a british trait as i’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience.",no
no,"   i had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways. the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. thank you so much. inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport. over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport. #happyautism# thank you",yes

yes,"     i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on 24/7, business class. once at lcy, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. a state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight. on a busy day, i waited for hours at the airport. the new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. i kept on waiting. the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. result: half a day wasted at lcy. i feel that ba’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. delays and cancellations can happen, however i have been flying ba +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from amsterdam and germany. also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.",no
yes,"     i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british airways for 23 feb 2019. on the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, i realized that i would not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation. when i arrived home, i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. i understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. however, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. i have been trying to speak to british airways on twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. british airways is being dishonest and should be avoided.",no
yes,"     london to shanghai. the concorde room in heathrow terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious. however, the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad. on the plane, the crew was very friendly and nice. dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okay. bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable, perhaps the best i have had. the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates. overall, the journey was great.",yes
no,"   i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline. however, their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible. if you have no problems this is a good airline. if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help. i recently flew to london from chicago. they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over 5 hours before he flight. they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. they then lost my luggage for 15 days. these things happen but customer service was impossible to use. when you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. they do not. you can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages. do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you.",no
no,"   good morning. i would like to write a review for british airways. it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me. but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. last year i went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time. i was pregnant at the time. the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions. regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england. somehow i missed the flight back. i have no excuse for this. when i realised i was in a complete state. i had a break down. i rang ba and sobbed down the phone. they were beyond amazing! they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards. customer service was outstanding. so compassionate and helpful. and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. i am beyond grateful for their help. i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible.",yes

yes,"     hong kong to copenhagen via london. the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen. we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor. we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august. on 2nd august, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. therefore, we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! on 3rd august, menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. unfortunately, when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in marstal on 4th. apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us. we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. we were so confused which bag was really missing. we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination. when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk. however, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. this service was totally unacceptable. we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! you can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. that's how ridiculous things have been for us. we are sure that you could do something about it. my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.",no
yes,    london gatwick to san jose costa rica. this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. i am sure the plane was the same. i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba. i am seriously considering not doing this again. the 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. i flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. the screens were from the ark. crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. i have heard to date zip. at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. that time at least we received avios. the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel.,no
no,"   inflight crew were very helpful, polite and caring. though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasant. the food and drink selection was pretty basic. however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost & found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful. i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding. upon approaching the ba counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain.  neither any empathy nor any willingness to help.",no

yes,"    a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce. although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a319 to and airbus a320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to europe). an overall very good experience on board this flight.",yes
yes,"    this was the worst experience i have ever had flying. there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our bags from american airlines. aa verified that they delivered the bags to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london. the bags did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our bags. i left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your lost and found never answered to file a claim. your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing. on the return flight from london to newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock. with an experience like this on our first vacation to london, i would do everything to never fly british airways again.",no
yes,"     london to larnaca. new a321neo, 4.5 hour flight. the aircraft was narrow, the food simple nothing worth spending my money. the staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it. no entertainment onboard. it is a small plane for this duration.

no,   gatwick to orlando. excellent customer service. on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. during the flight drinks were served and two food services. towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me. the return journey went without a hitch and ba's check in at orlando was quick and easy.,yes

yes,     the seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines. the seats are aging and uncomfortable. the forward-backward configuration is the most stupid i have seen. the cabin had 8 seats to a row and about 100 people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin. to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight. ,no
yes,"    no problems at the airport in vienna, it was easy to find the british airways check in desk. the flight was on time. the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very delicious. the only problem was at heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. but it is not an airliner mistake. after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways.",yes
yes,     malaga to london heathrow . a shambolic airline. rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga. ba sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began - sophisticated it setup they have! club europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despite what ba claim. cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in club cabin the service was very poor. arrived heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.  simply appalling trip and truly ripped off.,no
yes,     sydney to singapore. extremely disappointed trip. they are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel. our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can’t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure. many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected us badly. no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged,no
yes,"     london heathrow to inverness. having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer, i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which i had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. utterly appalling. now i’m hoping against hope i might make it home today, 3 days after setting off!",no
no,   heathrow to glasgow. again flight is delayed. it’s easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers. trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it. very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service.,no
yes,"    a supremely awful experience from beginning to end. flight to vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. only told once on board what the problem was. delays at baggage reclaim meant i didn’t get out of vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). this affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to it faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. queued for hours to get some information from someone. they rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass. this means i’ve missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival. had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst i wait for this. now i’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - i have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings back with me. these are merely the most significant issues, there were more and i’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.",no
no,   british airways flight to brussels from heathrow. check in problems and a hugely delayed flight. pay premium prices for a below average service. they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game.,no
yes,"     london to nice. i agree totally with the comments made in michael croft's review today. my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable it system that ba have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses. not just the ceo should go, but some others at the top.",no
yes,"     palma to london heathrow. how does british airways get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff / management? these issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll, preferably from the ceo down. just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel, when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019 - let alone try to make himself look all eco-friendly with such comments. i have been a loyal customer for over 48 years, and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now. my patience has run out. ",no
yes,"     london city to ibiza. disappointing. all the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn't turn up, so trip was ruined. got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week. trip was basic. the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits. british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by easyjet",no
no,"   london to faro. we booked our tickets (family of 7) two months before the flight with british airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service (so we thought). inbound flight seats has been booked and paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for the row 2 and 3. outbound flight row 6 and 7. two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to ""unlucky"" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. they've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well. customer service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never did. will i ever over pay (£2000 difference) so i can have ""good customer service with british airways ever again? - the answer is no . i am extremely upset (that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason), disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airways.",no
yes,"     calgary to london. staff were not in high standards. looked rushed and not polite, did not look professional enough. in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. there was not welcome snacks. we sat in the very last row and food choice ended. only chicken was our option to have. very sad and staff did not care about this situation.",no
no,"   london heathrow to sofia. we checked in online, so we went straight to baggage drop. it was quick and worked well, our bag was 25 kg, maximum is 23 kg, so we had to take 2 kg out. after that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. my daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. it was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. we got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. we headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 def. the seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. a321 so there was no ife. we had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. our route was a little different, instead of going over france, switzerland, etc, we went over germany, hungary, etc. the food was good and wasn't too expensive. we didn't buy anything really, just food. while coming into bulgaria, the views were nice. the landing was pretty good, despite the bump. eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. the verdict is that british airways are pretty good, despite the delay.",yes

yes,"     hong kong to london heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by boeing 777-300er. the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat. this negatively affects the legroom. the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television. they provide dinner and breakfast for me. it is quite abundant but not very delicious.",yes
yes,"     what happened to a great airline? got to heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. there was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. no apology just a shrug of shoulders. during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. speak to ba at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying. book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. get vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. what a useless organisation. i must state staff on plane very good.",no
yes,"     london heathrow to malaga in business class. full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight. held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. on boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. the breakfast standards (full english) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what ba shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. ba can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.",no

",no
yes,"    johannesburg to cape town return. this flight was operated by comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe. check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business. johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. their lounge, called slow is actually impressive. although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. these seats were old and plush, however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support. i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. there were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. the crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. they were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. in cape town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways, and they were the same price as the competition, south african airways. i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route. for the price paid, i'd be happy to fly them again.",yes
yes,"     grenada to gatwick. having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. the cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. the entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! but the family really found them entertaining. for me the real issue was the tight leg room - i am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! it was for me very tight. previously the seat format was 3-3-3. it is now 3-4-3. we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. we sat in a 2, which was more bearable. i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! despite best efforts to sleep, i failed..... i remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. in summary, it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",yes
yes,"     prague to london. a two hour flight on 27th july was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by ba. there was no sympathy or compensation , especially as our original flight was early morning, and with an email informing us of the delay, we could have stayed longer in the hotel. ",no
yes,"     london to dubai. lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways. the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled. the seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendly. if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats), then it would be perfect. that's my only note.",yes
yes,     tel aviv to toronto via london. the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent. the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly. the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights. i haven't travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights,yes
yes,"     i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class, from start to finish it was a shambles.  i was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate. the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum, no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this.",no
yes,"     the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in london the problems started. the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight. flight to larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. the team was very friendly. the service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. decent drinks and a good champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. it is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks.",yes

yes,"    seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight. no drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offered. no amenity kits. when i asked, they said none were left in stock. they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to british passports. i was not given a menu, i even had to ask for it. i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping. ok fine but even when i was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. i had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. and after all, no apologies from the staff. too many people are squeezed into business class. even though i could lie down 180 degrees, i had very little space at my seat. given the very expensive fare, i expected a much better service for business class passengers. i'm very disappointed and will never use it again. i won't recommend british airways business class to anyone!",no
yes,"    premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! the food (i use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. the veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (not really a saving grace). one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! i didn’t bother trying it. the look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! which in comparison to the outbound flight (london to orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. but that really shouldn’t happen. what is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered tsa line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it.",yes

yes,"    madrid to london with british airways. there is nothing left of business class on these flights. when they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke. seats are the same as coach, they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions, they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window! (see picture) and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. feel totally ripped off.",no
yes,"     gatwick to glasgow. awful experience. our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 8.50pm, so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car. we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive. our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute. british airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn’t their fault.",no
yes,     frankfurt to london. ba staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins. it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while - actually just clothes. when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight. only 1-2 minutes required. much longer spent unloading my luggage. we had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time.,no

yes,"    new york to glasgow via london. a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. the pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. i had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. the middle seat was unoccupied. enough leg space and storage space overhead. a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. the ife system was easy to use. a drink service preceded the meal service. i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird 100. sensing that i might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. the entree choices were chicken and pasta. i chose the later. very basic food. tea and coffee followed. before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. i could not figure out what was in the sandwich! the bathroom was clean. blankets and pillows were on every seat. alighting was quick. landing cards have been done away with. for the fare, i paid i was satisfied - no complaints. i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow. the announcement of the gate was made quite late. newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. it was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. i was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. no complimentary food or drink on this segment. the two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. the pilot introduced them as gorgeous. both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. it was supposed to be funny and engaging. i felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. the flight landed on time. overall, a positive experience but next time i will look into a non-stop flight to glasgow from new york. the transfer at heathrow is anxiety-inducing.",yes
yes,"    london heathrow to new york. the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience, refreshing to see these days. the quality of food and drinks was wonderful. there was plenty of leg room as well. we would definitely fly again with ba, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations. on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. that was fine i resolved to reading my book. just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, i replied, no but it was ok. she came back with a bottle of champagne, a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement! all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart! the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special!",yes
yes,"     gatwick to bermuda. boarded very quickly and on time, seating area smart, appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up. service very good, food was the best i have had from ba, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdue. duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, i hope this is a turning point for british airways. thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december, keep it coming.",yes
yes,     london heathrow to larnaca. perfect. the early morning departure meant that terminal 5 was unusually quiet. the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. the flight took off and landed on time. the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient. we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. all in all a very enjoyable trip.,yes
yes,"     ba 2616 and 2617 return trip from gatwick to cagliari. both flights on a saturday and were full. aircraft was an a320-200 on both legs. sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind club europe. sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet. didn’t bother with the new m&s on board service outward, but did on the return. the m&s sandwich was everything you would expect from an m&s sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard. it also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. the other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just 10 passengers. despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. outbound flight was fine, inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba. perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr.",yes
yes,"     heathrow to kalamata. heathrow t5 to kalamata, greece 8th june and return 1 week later. used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. also left kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, ryanair or jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. expensive (or course) m&s offerings for food but tasty enough. pleasant fa's so all in all decent flights. haven't used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right.",yes

yes,"     istanbul to london. my first flight in economy is the new a321 neo, the aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats. the seat does not recline, is very thin and ok for an hour flight. however 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours. the 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products.",yes
yes,"     i had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though i was already logged in. i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. it took me 2 days to achive this. i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the lhr-kul and return kul-lhr legs. i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app. checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. i was looking forward to flying on the boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full english or just an omelette, but the full english ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it. earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. for an over 12h flight, i think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music. our return flight from kl to london was very cold, the boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat.",no

no,"   london to vancouver. economy was a lot more cramped than i expected. ba had crammed seats in. crew were okay. food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame. flew back premium class, more room. i probably won’t use them in november when i go back. timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didn’t get a headache.",no
no,"❎   newcastle to delhi via london. at check-in , i was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. i paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. on my flight from london to delhi, during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. i then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature. when the dinner was served, ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking.

yes,"     standard, run of the mill airline for today's economy. flew tel aviv to new york, with a two hour layover in london heathrow. crew was fine, entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice. the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights. i  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. i submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable. not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways, as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500). ",no
yes,"     belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t5. check-in was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning. however, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that i wasn't an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. i knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and i was standing in the regular line when he called me. after about 20 minutes, i finally got a boarding pass to go through security. the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. my boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on american in the us, but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet. once we arrived to lhr, i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly t5. although i suppose it was pretty in some ways, i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. after my flight was called, i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. the flight product was just ok in my view. i had an exit row aisle seat, and while i had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. ife was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as delta's. the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. however, i arrived on time and promptly got my bag. the 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so i might fly them again, though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t5.",no

yes,"     london to nashville. the worst airline trans-atlantic. despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville, british airways ruined this trip. the flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing 787-9 from san jose. the airplane was filthy dirty in club class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, club class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. business class on british airways is the worst of any airline. the wifi was out of service. on late arrival in nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and i was unable to change clothes. on my return to the uk, i contacted british airways customer relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. i am now forced to haggle with british airways, and endure their woeful so-called customer relations department. it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. british airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow.

yes,     flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing 747-400 that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness!,yes
yes,"    just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba. the check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 ba staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk! the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. in the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. the adjacent jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and i counted 14 staff! the “welcome” sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. to cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! so unprofessional!",no
yes,"     gatwick to madrid. when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase. it didn’t arrive.  i was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which i did and given a number to call the next day. the representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. i was out during the day. when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase. it hadn’t been delivered. the next morning (sunday) i phoned the number again. the answer message said phone back on monday. as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless. i was leaving madrid at 8.30 pm. my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid. so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that i needed whilst there.",no
yes,"     my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. the flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. we missed our event. the plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom. i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight.",no
yes,"     i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin. somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn't fit the bag in the space remaining, so they kept the bag on my laptop bag. when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this, he asked me to keep my luggage down.  i was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out. how fair is this? ",yes
yes,"     london to delhi. a truly first class experience from check in to landing. i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience, this one was. check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent. the flight itself was wonderful, while i accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved.

yes,"     london heathrow to dubai. last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates. today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.

no,"   london to seattle. my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america. we have always been very satisfied with the service. unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! i’d like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight. advice was sought via radio, i was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park. we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was. many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed.",yes
yes,"     johannesburg to london. i booked a seat without luggage. firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. this caused an issue when trying to seat together. when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. this was not disclosed when the booking was made. it was irritating because one of us was ill. ",no
yes,     london to milan. evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead. free newspapers were available in the jet way. passengers were warmly greeted. i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. usual on board trolley service which i didn't use. flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate 20 minutes late. return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t5 which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. all in all a couple of very good flights.,yes
yes,"     the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. everything went smoothly and service was good. boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. much has been said about the ba ying-yang seat configuration. the seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. however the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the white company bedding is excellent. we had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. the service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. there was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. there could be no complaints in respect of catering. the a380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. our connecting flight to leeds was good, but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. it is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds. the airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. there was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.",yes
yes,"    london heathrow to los angeles. very nice experience. i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had. from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. food was good, not great, but very good. seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors. aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls.",yes
yes,"    cpt is definitely getting its act together: ba's galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world. that's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution. the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. the dinner service was according to the new cw 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. on the whole, i think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. a good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.",yes
yes,"     sofia to belfast via london. the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible. i am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. where did the service go? there was a bad delay on the belfast flight.  we were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts. the delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from sofia.  i will never set foot on this airline again. ",no
yes,"     lima to gatwick. helpful and courteous cabin crew.  the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. the screen was small and in poor condition. movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor. the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset. a 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system.",no
yes,"    inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways. service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight. i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights.",no
yes,"    i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. however, into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and i needed to ask for a pillow. the menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. the evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was ok served with freezing cold cutlery. bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. the breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane, insisting i needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. i am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. when i arrived in singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight.",no
yes,"     flight was ok, minor delay didn't both me. what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time? they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight.",no
yes,"     
gatwick to barbados return. i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. however, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). no bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so i presume it was missed. my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. however, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. when they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. my wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. overall, the return flight was extremely poor.",no
yes,"     marseille to london. i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight. i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. i went to the ba helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. luckily, i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.

yes,"     gatwick to malaga. check in was fairly quick. the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. if you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. the food and drink offering was very good. tasty and varied. on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. the food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. what was very nice was, near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. i wouldn’t expect this, and i’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered. priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. overall a decent flight, and very good value as i paid using avios. being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.",yes
yes,"     boston to london heathrow, was excited to experience a380 for the first time. paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window. seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. the food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. there was serious bumps along the way midflight. the a380 being so massive easily absorbed it. return was on a b777 - flight was not full but almost full. the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. the baggage drop area however was a disaster. none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. the boarding was again very orderly. both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher. ",yes
yes,"     london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. a wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. for once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. the ife remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its long-in-the-tooth first class when their new club suites are launched.",yes
yes,"     this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba 174 from jfk new york to heathrow on tue 14th may. i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving ny. despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. they were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section i was in. i do hope that this information is passed on.",yes
yes,"     london to aberdeen. before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group 5. i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate. i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags. being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance.

yes,"     i paid an extra £500 for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. the seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. the whole experience was very poor, not premium in any way. the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium, a whole different experience. i would be happy to pay for their premium seats. i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium. i felt a complete waste of £500.",no
yes,     faro to heathrow. flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster. we fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off. spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it. same happened on flight out too. it is a shambles and a disgrace. waited 39 mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again. avoid at all costs.,no
yes,"    vancouver to london. an excellent flight on ba. i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac, especially on this flight, ba were way ahead of the competition. seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding. professional, smiling, friendly. they embodied ba at their very best.",yes
yes,"     gatwick to tenerife. all so wrong. lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of it. paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure. apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madness. this is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.have just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires, did not even bother to look at ba.",no
yes,"    washington to london. having travelled out to washington from heathrow on 23/04/19 first class i wasn't overly impressed. although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. my return journey couldn't have been more different. the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. nothing short of amazing. i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.",yes
yes,"    rome fiumicino to london city. a ba cityflyer service. no wait to check in. aircraft was not full. we pushed back early and arrived early. this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise. cabin service was pleasant and professional. a really excellent flight.",yes
yes,"     london to shanghai. the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time. the plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), it took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. they seemed to be short on staff. however, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before i’d even been offered a drink. the service was exceptionally poor. i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. as a gold card holder, you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? i’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as cathay, jal or finnair. the only reason that i’ve given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. ultimately though - sorry ba, not good enough.",no
yes,"    their customer service is horrible. lost our bags. here we sit in london after 2.5 days of wearing the same clothing. we fly out in 3 hours to barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. i spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. we have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle, is heartbreaking. not one single person at british airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. one customer service agent even asked me if we would be ok getting out to heathrow to ""pick them up."" truly the worst customer experience i've had.",no
yes,"     london city to zurich, i fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, the flight was delayed initially by an hour, i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed. around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne, brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. thanks to the crew.",yes
yes,"     i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). we lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. i understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life.",no

miami to london heathrow with british airways. top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members. perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast. had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected. on-time arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers.",yes
yes,"     houston to london. the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem. i’ve no problem with that, i like travelling safely. i thought, well i’m sure i’d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window. i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problem. he fetched me a sandwich and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen. later when the liquid refreshment cane round, both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it.",no
yes,"     london to delhi. the worst business class trip for us. seats much smaller than business class on singapore air, thai international, eva air, qantas; not seated together - same surname, mr and mrs - but moved after. no privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, ipad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. film/tv selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. the food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. breakfast had no jam with the croissant. nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. the crew didn’t put themselves out. if one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. i would never choose to travel ba again.",no
yes,"     bucharest to london. my flight with british airways was 7 hours delayed (from a european destination to london). i applied for compensation for this delay. initially i was informed that under eu regulations i would receive 400 euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that i was no longer getting compensated. british airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. however, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. i believe that, if not on legal basis, british airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within europe) is significant. many times i picked to fly with british airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. but this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airways.",no
yes,     london heathrow to bengaluru. i found the crew very friendly and even humorous! whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (i was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! ,yes
no,"   madrid to london. we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. the original booking was from iberia (part of iag which operates ba, iberia and air lingus) ba clearly do not integrate into iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba (these flights were operated by iberia and ba, ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow). ba explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats. no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice. we'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag / ba has let the customer down, again. just simply poor ba  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!",no
yes,     dublin to london heathrow. british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. i booked online and found that process very easy. the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. the check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. the flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable.,yes
yes,"     london to seattle. my seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for seattle flights to europe (ba is the only one flying 747s to europe from seattle). overall the product is outdated. service was not at the level it used to be. staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  no additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. of course if you ask for something you do get it. there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  i hope ba will improve their act. i certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future.",no

yes,"     london to doha. similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage.",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to houston. despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. they really seemed to be enjoying their work. lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic. well done ba. frequent drinks runs were made. despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally. the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late. this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. all very stressful.",yes
no,   larnaca to london. this a320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight. if the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing. ,no
yes,"     i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. when i tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i would have had to pay about thirty pounds. the check-in area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. the check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train. the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans. one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in german. the flight arrived reasonably promptly.",no
yes,     the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  some of the to buy m&s food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty. the staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. hardworking crew.,yes

yes,"     bridgetown to london gatwick. paid for a business class flight. the onboard service was abysmal. no refreshments offered on boarding. dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. i requested ‘express’ service, which didn’t happen. website advertises ‘premium levels of service’ and ‘every journey unique and unforgettable.’ the service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the lounge and extra loyalty points. all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. really?",no
yes,"     st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight. it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport. i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy. the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article 7.3 of ec 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba. however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. ba’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of ba but for me their service is going backwards. the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it. article 10 of ec regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.",no
yes,"     chicago to london. cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. was finally put on a different flight. on the way home, because my first flight was through american airlines, and the second through british airways (all in the same booking), i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight, as i was redirected every time to their website. couldn’t check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. i always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but ba wouldn’t allow me to do this.",no
yes,     london to bangalore. this was the worst experience. i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude. i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter. i found the food portions so meagre. not sufficient for a child also.  british airways is sad in every sense of the term.,no

yes,"     london to seville. following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor, i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue. they understood the problem and gave me a full refund. the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem. i don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see ba treat their customers with care.",yes
yes,"     doha to paris via london. this is the first time using ba since october 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was ok not as personal but alright. where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class.",yes

yes,     i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago. i had requested a special meal but that was not available. when i complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 k miles. the bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones. the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest. video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing. cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button. in flight entertainment is poor. ,no
yes,     leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow. customer services handling of my question never answered it. three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare. i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. they never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when i indicated one checked bag. i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. book lhr las at that time and one bag included. customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive. ,yes
yes,"     dallas to london heathrow in first class. this is the worst experience i have had on a flight. the crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. this was nothing but a waste of money. i doubt very much i will go back to british airways again.",no
yes,"     tenerife to heathrow. effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. when i tried to put my seat back to recline, i estimate it moved around 5 degrees. leg room is also non existent. m&s food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand. they are professional, friendly and courteous. it's clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.",no
yes,"    heathrow to larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. m&s food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. larnaca to heathrow - two messages received while in larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". the flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". in addition i was incorrectly charged eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. the only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the customer service manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. how british airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me.",no
yes,"     los angeles to london. a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! well done ba for providing such a good product and service.",yes
yes,"     london to phoenix, ba289 yesterday. the plane was supposed to land at 1835. however, it landed at 1940. because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario, california aboard american airlines. by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. the flight departs at 2037. i went to the ground crew of american airlines, they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. they then directed me to british airways. i went to the ground attendant of british airways and she told me to go back to american airlines to get it re booked. i went back to american airlines then they told me again to back to british airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. i went back to british airways with the american airlines supervisor. the british airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. she did not offer any explanations or anything. american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. i ended up getting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines.",no

yes,"     rome to london. one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights. the online website is very clear and easy to use. check-in procedure was smooth. the gate was very close to the shopping area. boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don’t serve anything free on all european routes.",yes

yes,"     tampa to gatwick. i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and i can't get on the plane. they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that i paid for, but never received.

yes,"    london heathrow to madrid. i travel from lhr regularly. british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality. as a frequent traveler, i've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats. this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. the lounge at heathrow terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. i'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways. keep it up guys.",yes
yes,"     gatwick to st lucia return. recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. tickets bought in august 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return, having flown out premium economy. arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking. apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. fuming all the way back to london, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when i asked for coffee) and filthy food. complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service 10 days later. ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. ba has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. general quality of ba service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. ba is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. avoid this airline if you possible can. and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in club and £70 in premium economy. ba, you are having a laugh with the flying public. on this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.",no
yes,"     it's been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. from the time of arriving at london heathrow t5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. on the way back i asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though i'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. the entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch. both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of cathay pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean. overall a very pleasant flight, thanks ba. is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder?",yes
yes,"    
london heathrow / pisa return. my wife and i fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in tuscany. sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using avios. this return trip was the latter. it is what it is. the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. ba should be ashamed of themselves. the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. the new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. the seats are the biggest con. three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. on the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. as a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the us, japan and the middle east - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest plcs in the country - i think i know a bit about running companies. i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba. last week when i was away, i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. so what would i do with club europe? i'd make it the best in europe. the seat would be larger, like an arm chair. a 2+2 configuration. there would be a nice centre table. charge ports for phones/laptops. headsets. tv screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". nice cutlery and glass/china ware. hot meals. and i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""build value guys"" and the profits will follow. its the oldest dictum in the book. i will give credit where credit is due. on the way back, on the ground, the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. very nice chap. we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. fas in both directions were very good.",no
yes,    edinburgh to boston via london. the planes are ancient and need to be replaced. if these were cars they would have an antique plate. the seats are uncomfortable and worn. there is no lumbar support. the space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. it’s really claustrophobic. the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. so for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. the m&s menu is expensive and offers limited choices. meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good. there was one member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. british airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.,no
yes,"     gatwick to mauritius. my wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. trading standards are also being informed. it didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work. i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (i am a licensed engineer). a marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return. british airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for.",no
no,"   flew out of heathrow on 22nd feb to new york, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour. the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were. the crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. thank you to all involved on that flight.",yes
yes,"     horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return. i am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and i find the leg room too cramp. the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time. it was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. the food was barely edible. coming back on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up. i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. this was the worst flight i have flown on. last long haul ba flight for me.",no
yes,"     new york to venice via london. staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. booked business class. first flight, overnight from jfk to heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. chair is set up so i’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up. no instructions for the transition between ba flights. now i’m on the flight from heathrow to venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. i didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. i won’t fly ba again. ",no
yes,"     chicago to london heathrow. club class on british airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old b747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of club class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. to leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. the crew from chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. breakfast was inedible, and i returned it uneaten. the lounge at o'hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. insufficient chairs, and a single, old tv. does no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers.",no
yes,"     london to chicago. could it get any worse? the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing 747-400. the british airways first class product doesn't come up to modern business class standards. this particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. the first class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. british airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product. all that can be said about this airline is woeful. the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment.",no
yes,"     prague to london heathrow. very disappointing service. cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley. on the bright said, i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices.",no
yes,"     london city to florence. my flight was at around 7am in the morning. not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking. on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldn’t select any flights on the same day. interestingly i was able to find & book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with £100 more, of course. why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page? ",no
yes,"     london to johannesburg. since the aircraft was half full, i was looking for a great flight. we left on time, and that was the only positive point. i started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. i told her that i would love a g&t to start with, and then i will read the menu. she told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. i insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (g&t, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  never was i offered wine or coffee. the lights were turned off, and i did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  other passengers in business where treated the same and complained.",no
yes,"     doha to london heathrow. flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. breakfast was served which was ok. cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. there is good and bad still with ba - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand.",yes
yes,"     miami to tel aviv via london. at miami airport on october 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent, so professional, nice and helpful to the every last detail. now on february 2019 calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agent. she explained everything in such detail. you are doing great with such fantastic employees. ",yes
yes,"     london to seoul. i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go. the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. the entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. a similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area ba might want to look into. all in all the service was good and worth the price. for ground service ba, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to new york jfk. bag drop did not go well. lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. on time arrival, a good flight. cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. i thought this was a good flight.",yes
yes,"    san diego to london. from the moment that i boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. as a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. this was a club world ticket - so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service. however, i wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. i complained to ba when i got home but they weren't interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us & mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline.",no
yes,"     gatwick to st lucia. flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up. well lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food. cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant. i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience i will consider them in the future. much improved, well done.",yes

no,"   london to tampa. ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss, i just got a new one. the new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad). so on top of the new suitcase, i had to actually pay ba to check the new bag. cost me over $100 for their mistake. they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. you will get an email a month later saying ""i'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"". make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.

yes,"     my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba-228 from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the 12th february 2019. every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. the plane was shabby and dated. the seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly. one ear bud on the headphones did not work. the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. they were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. there was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option.",no
yes,"     bridgetown to gatwick. i couldn't imagine that first class on ba would be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar, emirates, etihad, singapore, thai etc for double the price. cabin, seats and food equals business class. one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound. cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. but first class on ba is not worth the fare. when i complained to customer service after i got home, all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller.

yes,"     london to athens. classic ba love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster. problems in december 2018 at heathrow check-in when ba check-in and baggage management it systems went down for at least 90 minutes. total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. then flight does not have enough food onboard. at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum.",no
yes,"     i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow. in the beginning everything went normal and smooth. check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow (fair enough). afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. after that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. this caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. we received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. the flight was full of overseas travellers. we spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london.",no

yes,"     tokyo to london. i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing 787. we had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita. we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. the food and wines were really good. i had a beautifully-presented japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen. on the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo. we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",yes
yes,     london to tokyo haneda. my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher. we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at heathrow was great. we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. the food and alcoholic drinks were great. i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife. my wife and i both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.,yes

berlin to johannesburg via london. the short haul flight between berlin and london was okay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. because of an engine problem, the flights from lhr to jnb was delayed by 2:45h. british airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. inside the a380, the ife boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space.",yes
yes,    new york jfk to london heathrow with british airways. an extremely average flight. nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad. the flight was smooth and felt quite short. the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable. the inflight entertainment needed some work.,yes
no,"   i've always favoured british airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. however ba have stripped both the above perks. i now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet, yet you pay almost double. then today i flew back from denmark with sas, and it was amazing and made ba look cheap. not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 euros!). outstanding.",no
yes,"    new york to london via geneva with british airways. the plane was late, not an issue. but some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner, they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly. on a 7 hour flight, they served us the food 40mins after departure, then 20mins at the most after started clearing, we were not even close to finish eating. then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. this was really poor service. especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us. thats what you call bad customer service! ps: i was charged 100$ for a luggage, after buying my ticket 350$",no
yes,"    a380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience. the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs. it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. the ife was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. wifi was available but i didn't make use of it. breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered. deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at t5 and the lack of a stand. overall, a reasonable flight but not first class.",yes
yes,"    
the 2-3-2 seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. a full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in first. the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement. the fish option for the main course was some of the best food i've had in the air. the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight. breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. arrival was ahead of schedule.",yes
yes,"     london to johannesburg. smooth check in via club world desks. fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly. lounge was ok, food a little better and staff seemed more attentive. we were able to use the spa which was nice. showers were fine with no queues. flight left on time. my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for 5 hours, lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777’s which (as my son says) have a gap between stool and seat sometimes. crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed. the csd seemed to go through the motions only. arrival fine and baggage was first on belt. a good flight",yes
yes,"     ba836 on 19 jan. excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe. cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent. the club europe catering was excellent, i had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. the main course was beef ratatouille with a do&co dessert pot. this was the best inflight meal i've had on a short haul flight. on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal.",yes
yes,"     whatever happened to the world's favourite airline? returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a worn-out boeing 777. my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off. i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn't work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'i'll put it in the book'. no apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. the food was awful, neither my wife or i could finish it. it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. my wife's entertainment screen, didn't work, the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently. it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. i believe the 777s out of gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so i'm glad i didn't. my frustration with ba grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too.",no

yes,"    copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british airways. there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight. but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and i enjoyed the flight. the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. during the second flight from lhr to ams, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. like how the taxi from polderban is almost as long as the flight itself.",yes
yes,"     antigua to gatwick. apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. we checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. we had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. when asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue.",no
yes,"    i understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. i paid $813 to fly r/t lax-buh and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. i understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? in my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. it is baffling. the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. and why am i flying boac? they owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. on top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". for normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been. and of course you only get compensation by patronising them again. now i know: ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced.",no
yes,"    london to miami. worst long haul business class. that annoying divider, the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats! the service is non-existent, unless they are serving you the meal. if you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member, they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. the toilets are dirty and basic. i’m a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines. they’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap.",no
yes,"    i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room. boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. the staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. a hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. quality red and white wine was served. the inflight movie selection was ok. a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. not my best flight.",yes
yes,"    boarding was fairly quick, the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored. i was lucky that no one was sitting next me, so i had some more room. the pre take off drink was water or orange juice.  within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. wine selection was very american with jug wines. the movie selection was ok. the pe seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. the 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies. ",no
yes,"     bangalore to london. ground experience not great - at lhr automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated. at blr, no online check-in available and slow process. plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. seat itself could have more width (i kept bumping the vod control and i'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. vod itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). to top it off, on outbound leg the vod stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that. food volume ok, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy.",no
yes,"     barcelona to new york via london. i was in barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check. my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections. when i finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly. it took me nearly 24 hours to travel from barcelona to jfk.  when i arrived, my luggage wasn't there so i filed a claim. i called and emailed every day and they couldn't find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation. eight days later, they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery. the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days. as a result, they have offered me no compensation for damages.

yes,"     we recently flew from london to bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. so we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys. so i approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. i was advised by the representatives to ring ba service line. made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. they instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation. despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund.",no

",no
yes,"     when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat, it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one's seat. as the arm rests do not go all the way up, the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over. there is little leg room and no leg rest. the boeing 777 ife screen is smaller than the ones on the british airway's 747-400s and could do with an upgrade. the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew.",yes
yes,"     boston to london. world traveler seats. nice headrest. legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat. the seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british airways' magazine or even use my ipad. we ordered special meals (halal and low sodium). the muslim meal (chicken tikka masala with naan) was restaurant quality. flavorful and not spicy hot. the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's. the low sodium meal - herb roasted chicken, tomato rice, petite broccoli, diced red pepper and carrots was delicious. dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries. the ife was very good. bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages.

yes,"     newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy (world traveler plus). i paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. was it worth it? i'd say broadly yes, though i wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. before boarding: premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and india to us/canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding: you board in zone 3 after first/business & the oneworld elites. that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. this means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. in flight: there is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). there is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: the 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. so a somewhat wider seat. seat pitch is also decent. these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. the seat back screen is large and easy to use. there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. the 777 version used on the lhr-blr sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. this gives it a sort of cosy feel. you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. that helped me stretch out for sure. the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. food: nothing much here. i didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. it was ok - nothing to write home about. all in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. worth it on extra long haul like us to india. bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",yes
yes,"     london to berlin scheduled for 21st december. on approach to the airport, i got a message saying that my flight was canceled. no explanation was given. as i arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. eurostar). my costs would  be reimbursed. the airport staff also said no further help from british airways is available on the day to due airport issues. i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day. as it was christmas, prices were very high. after i arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with british airways started, and british airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).

yes,"     london to mumbai. i have had my battles with the leadership at ba because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles. now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards. this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. although i travelled economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. if i have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. is this ba's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. having been grumpy about several aspects of ba's service in the past, i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.",yes

yes,"     our return journey from sydney to london, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. we flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. we were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. they said they would contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. by the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, i had already received an email from ba c/s and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. however, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another ba flight. i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me. there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. the flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class.",no
yes,"    i had flown british airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey back home (thailand) on the 12th december 2018. i arrived at leeds bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. check-in process took less than a minute as i already done online check-in, this means i just dropped my luggage. the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (i flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily i was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. as the flight departed the crew started on board service. i didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. it was one hour flight so i didn't expect the top service standard. the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic. overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.",yes
no,"   gatwick to tenerife. this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! g-medk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on. i paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. it was like sitting on concrete! i would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 i believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11f a little more bearable. staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later. i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion, i used some avios to make the flight less expensive. easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these ba flights. with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.

yes,"     johannesburg to london. i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. as it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. the trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. the crew never came back until breakfast. that flight was a total disappointment.",no
yes,"    london to kuala lumpur. this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner 787. was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come back to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years. i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. i made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30b) has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. the tv screen on 30b was also not working and i didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. i would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a380. i am dreading on my next return flight back to london. crews were friendly and helpful. no fault with that.",no

yes,     our flight from seattle to london in november 6th was canceled due to technical problems. after waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the ba associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight. they offered us a flight that would arrive in london late november 8th. it would take us 16 hours. since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november 8. i would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. my trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days. they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. i filed a claim online based on their instruction.  the customer relation phone number is disconnected. in fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”! the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist. after 1.5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them. ,no
yes,"     gatwick to barbados. we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec. it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal. however, the walk to the gate is miles. it has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. the north terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. i'd guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the s.t. my first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st class is holding up. there are scuff marks everywhere. surface scratches. bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. it's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. needs a paint job at least. the motley flowers (that ba removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer. (i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the ""superb"" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world's most hated business class in the sky. i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",no
yes,"     moscow to london. fantastic first class service. the moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent runway views. quick boarding, and i was escorted to my seat by the crew. the new first seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. there's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal i've had. drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. the crew were very attentive and friendly with it. a fantastic experience, and i'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin.",yes
yes,"     johannesburg to london . for supper i asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as i don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons. given with no problems. for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused. i explained i don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water."" we don't keep hot water, i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers"". that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. i kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining i have been waiting. he said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. i felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.",no
yes,"     bridgetown to gatwick. booked our return flight in business/club class (at £1,000+ each) only to find ba want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  awful seating with their ying/yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. poor cabin staff attitude - i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""we only do that in first class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"". i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - this happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. if you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.",no
yes,"     glasgow to new york via london. morning flight from gla to lhr was ok. i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk. on the jfk flight the service was fantastic. the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. we left and arrived on time. the seat and legroom was fine. my mothers ife didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. the cabin crew were very friendly.",yes
yes,"     sydney to london via singapore. i'm hugely disappointed with the business class trip. the seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. if you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. if you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. after i watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. the ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. i would not recommend ba to anyone.",no
yes,"     johannesburg to london. in contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. the dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. breakfast was pretty good. arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight.",no
yes,"     antigua to gatwick. one of the worst business class experience. entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt. ",no
yes,"     gatwick to barbados. first class was third rate. a disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. i have avoided flying with ba for the last 20 years, now i remember why. avoid them if your route allows.",no
yes,"     cape town to london. very unimpressive amenities and service. unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (i gave him one of the two sets on mine). i, on the other hand never got the main course. i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.",no
yes,"     bucharest to london. they are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haul. in bucharest they did not park at the terminal, they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus. they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to. i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we're being scammed.",no
yes,"    kuala lumpur to mexico city via london. the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring. however, during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with muslim needs on food. they are polite and talk to me with big smiles. so, when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018, i wished i will be able to meet them again. hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip.",yes
yes,"     miami to london. ba are going downhill . having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey, the choice was exactly the same this time.  i explained to the steward that i didn’t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it basically. he said i should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  the snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. the light didn’t work on my seat so i couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv, watching was incredibly hard. entertainment having travelled four times in last month, films have barely changed. i won’t be travelling with them again if at all possible.",no
yes,"    
i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food served. before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company. overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa.",yes
yes,"    arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. during this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. despite this, ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba's transformation into an overpriced easyjet. will not fly with them again.",no
yes,"     we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl. every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy. on october 17th i booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october 31st coming back november 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. on october 19th my grandfather passed away. we put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. in addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience i’ve ever encountered.  i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future. ",no
yes,"     gatwick to las vegas. boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best i’ve ever had on a long haul flight. the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days. all in all a very enjoyable flight.",yes
no,"   nassau to london. premium economy on ba is a joke. highlighted by my friday morning 7am breakfast. a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, croissant and an equally sealed banana bread/cake. no hot food/drink; awful. that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in economy. the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. ba premium economy - forget it. other airlines do this better.",no
yes,     phoenix to accra via london. i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in. she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently. my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well. just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.,yes
yes,"     manchester to london. the bag drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already. the staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. not exactly best of british, and i’ll certainly not be recommending!",no
yes,"     san diego to hannover via london. i booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london. american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in 3 days. i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference. a bizarre exchange followed. first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. i told them to look at the ticket. you can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  i booked with ba on their website. they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight. this is miserable customer service.",no
yes,     london heathrow to stuttgart. absolutely disgusted with ba. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. ba had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart. this has proven too difficult. the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.,no
yes,"     london to johannesburg. turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us. it was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly mr convivial. the concorde room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. boarding involved lining up according to group. this smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but i guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. the dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. the wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous lpgs, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. sleep quality was considerably better than club world, although the cabin temperature was a little high. overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.",yes
yes,"     having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing 787, i was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. i rejected ba's offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to get a different ba aircraft. when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost. my husband and i were forced to sit separately. at the booking in i was told that they could not find ""proof"" that i had paid for selected seats. i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned. on the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my tv did not work. the staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat. on return, ba customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. despite sending two detailed messages, i received the same response. completely inadequate service by ba (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints.",no
yes,"     vancouver to london heathrow. i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what i needed. the booking process was not smooth and very stressful, i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. the 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok. the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby. i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. all the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, i'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.",yes
yes,"     boston to nairobi via london. the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow. the cabin crew service was below standard. i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because i was watching a movie. i  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry. the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from boston to heathrow. it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port. cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. i'm probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better. ",no
yes,"     basel to san fransisco via heathrow. i'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a380 and i has reserved an aisle seat. the food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the uk). the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. you couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and i'm not big. the recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. i feel sorry for larger people. the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. the staff seem challenged with certain situations. next time i'm off to the us i will look for an alternative airline.",no
yes,     london to lyon. the flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30. ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. then the customer service has been very useless. such a very bad experience. i do not recommend flying with them.,no
yes,     london to boston. i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat. the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight. superb customer service.,yes
yes,    stockholm to london. standard configuration on short haul european flights. business class still 3 seats each side of the isle. middle seat fitted with a tray. had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business. drinks served with a smile and the food also. food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there. the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.,yes
yes,"     amsterdam to london arrived 33 minutes late - three delays, taking off, landing, and getting the walkway to the airplane. this has happened twice this year. i fly klm 90% of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely. i fly british on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed. i’m sure it’s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day.

yes,"    i would not recommend this airline. i travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. baggage allowance: only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170aud extra. this is the strictest airline i have ever used. all other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. in-flight meal: on the way to sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. it is an 8 hour flight! make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. you don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. customer service: from the get go the customer service was appalling. it is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with ba was stressful. they wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and i had a slight delay which meant i couldn't go on the same flight. at the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. how do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? they then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. we had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. don't bother flying ba.",no

yes,"     while it is still fresh in my mind, i’d like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from st.petersburg to london heathrow on 23rd october 2018. the check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. the captain was informative. my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the m&s buy on board option was a bit tedious. disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. this flight has restored my faith in ba. well done to the superb crew!",yes
yes,"     london to philadelphia. i upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because i  wanted to experience ba’s business class in the boeing 787, but i was disappointed. while the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. pre-flight they offer you a beverage, i asked for rose champagne and i was told “i guess i have to go find a bottle and open one”. in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. i was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. you get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. you also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wi-fi on this flight. you get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. ba has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option. they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers.",no

yes,"    full flight from muc to lhr with british airways. on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly, so is the baggage allowance, plane although not new was clean. you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights. the departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected. we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t5. the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us. service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again. when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters.",yes

yes,"     london to toronto. 14 day trip to play golf with my father, and ba lost my clubs for 7 days. dealing with ba lost luggage/customer service was brutal, they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve them. i had packed all my clothes with my clubs. first days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials. flight home from lhr-yyz was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn't stay upright. the ife system badly needs upgrading, and no power ports at the seats - grueling 7.5hr flight. as bad as i thought air canada was they are light years ahead of ba.

yes,"     johannesburg to london. i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class. i have seen a change for the worst in ba service, and it does not seem to get any better. bedding finally a decent pillow, a very good one indeed. the rest is a waste of money unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. i don't expect top food in a plane but i expect service. if you announce things, make sure you have them. on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  you must eat when they order you to eat. they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordon's. you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner. entertainment, make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view. ba offers you the most limited offer.",no
yes,"     singapore to london heathrow. it's my first time traveling on british airways. the seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. so you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). there are 8 club world seats per row for 777-300er, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. the cabin service was as good as expected. however, i saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night. there could be some other choices.",yes
yes,"     london to los angeles. booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. the flight i chose was a boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before. we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a380 to a twenty one year old jumbo. we were then seated right at the back of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. after a few hours i went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. the seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. i bought wifi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. we have avoided ba now for some time, except where there is no other option as on club europe. but with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. we only took this trip to use up some avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from lax on virgin atlantic. never again, ba club world offered is a farce in today's business market.",no
yes,"     miami to london heathrow. as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with ba's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. my issue was with faulty equipment onboard. issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills. i now have 91000 avios going to waste as my business will be going else where.",no

no,"   calgary to rome via london. my wife and i booked our 10th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return, with british airways, sept 17-27. this was my first trip in europe, and we spent almost $8500 cad on first class tickets. the flight calgary to london (stopover) was ok. i got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next 8 hours. one would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card. i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. the vacation itself was great. on the day of the return flight, our trenitalia train broke down in naples, and we were 80 mins late. my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. we tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, facebook page, google etc. we tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. my wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. it was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. my wife was ok and could go through but i could not. we asked the 3 ladies at the british airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears. i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. she was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour. after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. no apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome. we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british airways. like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support.",no
yes,"     london to bangkok. flew british airways for the first time in a couple of years. terminal 5 is rubbish. it may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  t5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. i usually fly eva and others from terminal 2 and i would avoid t5 if possible from now on. the aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iphone 8+ (without the technology). the food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. the crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. the flight had some drunks on the way back to the uk, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, i did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why i went with them this time), then i guess i’ll have no choice.",no

yes,"    london - pisa (return). i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany. this, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. outbound we went through the ""first"" wing check in at t5. (we are gold card members). the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok. the south lounge was rammed. we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast. the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice. the captain popped out for the loo, and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. a very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm ali. we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken. downed a couple of g&ts. fas on both flights were great. there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. the seating is still hopeless. three seats between two and zero legroom. ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class. the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points. the every day fare price is ludicrous.",no
yes,"     i was in prague flying british airways back to heathrow. apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed. my 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. there was no british airways person at the prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. the sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into prague. this consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. so after calling british airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, i went  online and booked the flight. because of the late timing, i was charged $356usd. then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, i finally learned that ba would only reimburse me the non-used flight that i had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 usd. they also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until i receive it. is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? i will never fly british airways again.",no

yes,"     brindisi to london. flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers. there was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. service in club europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to ryanair. the brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look club europe meal service. sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. and, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. it's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.",no
yes,"     chicago to london. i have flown long haul many times with both ba and virgin premium economy. in my view whilst the virgin product has improved, the ba equivalent has deteriorated such that virgin is significantly better. despite booking and paying for seats with ba this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of wt+ on the a380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. for the first time in many years i found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). went through 3 layers of customer service with ba on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off. plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg.

no,"   london heathrow to dubai. this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba. i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. ba's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. we were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet. the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. it is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. the champagne that ba offer in first is superb. i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted. choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker. food was very tasty and well presented. i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. i cant really fault any of it. it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. attentive with out being over-bearing. witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. they were superb. wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first. whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis. you have to do it once though!",yes

yes,    i always like travelling on a ba a380. seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes. however the food is really poor. in the last 12 months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british airways. thankfully ba airline staff are always the best.,yes
no,   london heathrow to düsseldorf. really good crew on both legs of the journey. got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus. loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too.,yes
yes,"    london to athens. since i started using ba in 2011, i can only say that the quality becomes worse. the leg room in business class in a320 is the same like in economy. the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. the meal choices are poor: i had to choose between curry and fish pie. also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. the on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines. tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from heathrow (not bas fault, but at the end of the day i experience delays). what is that makes ba in european flights distinct? probably nothing.",no
yes,"     london heathrow to singapore. had a great experience in the concorde room, and galleries first lounges in heathrow t5. i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because i expressed a slight interest, and for that i am thankful. the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. the seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. the seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. you get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so i never ran out of room. the pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. the flight left slightly behind schedule, but at heathrow, this is something you expect. very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. i had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i would have it again! once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. the bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well. when i awoke, i was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. the breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. the inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, tv programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. the system was responsive and was good quality, although i did not watch any films, so i cannot speak of the sound quality. the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice. they really made this already special experience even more special. if you want to treat yourself to ba first, i would thoroughly recommend it.",yes
yes,"     philadelphia to london. nice plane, nice seats, low quality service on the plane. both my husband and i ordered low sodium meals. his was delivered, mine was not. when asked, the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray lsml. obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and i was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. not the same as my husbands meal, so i have to take the airlines word lsml that it was low sodium. attendants serving coffee missed us and when i pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. one pass through the cabin for drinks. after that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. i expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal. before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew. i thought british airways was better than this. ",no
yes,"     london to las vegas i experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset. the tray table did not stow properly so the armrest remained at a 45 degree angle with the metal frame exposed. the seat cushion was so badly sunken it was as if totally unpadded. one air vent for the 3-seat row and no in-seat power. luggage was mislaid for 33 hours, even with priority tag. after writing to british airways regarding disappointing flight, ba customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a $63usd voucher toward future ba travel to make up for their shoddy service. if you have a choice, choose another airline!",no
yes,"     zagreb to london and during the check-in (24 hours before, i checked in via app) i was offered no choice of seating. during the flight, i was asked by stewardess if i would like any food - i find that approach not pleasant at all. i was not personally invited to use the lounge. i find that lacking for a business class fare. ",no
yes,"     i booked a round trip from milan to california for my honeymoon. first flight milan to san francisco via london, while returning flight was from los angeles to milan always via london. both flights faced 1 hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination. when you check in the bags, business class is mixed with other one world members so it is not exclusive at all. only first has some real advantages. we found business lane crowded for the category.  worst business class experience and totally disappointed.",no
yes,"     toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt+. finally, ba has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. however, premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge. food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a 777. water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london. (apparently 3 are loaded in london for the o/w leg but none for the return.) friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. the salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. got a couple of hours sleep. however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working. a reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. the standard t&cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (ba should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) after leaving toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. for the return leg, i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise. fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers. excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew. a fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old biz food service. overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c. after a pleasant 3 hour nap, i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. at the gate early and fast bags too. this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. i hope gatwick catches up so ba don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative. on the o/w leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy. i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. all that said, i felt that ba is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. long may this improvement last!",yes
yes,"     san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a380 - a very quiet smooth flight. did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. after the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to priority lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. of course the usual ba club class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive business class world. welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa. ok meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. really very good fa's - made you feel welcome. landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. as usual i have mixed feelings about ba - if we are lucky enough to fly club/business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat. if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat.",no
yes,     london to dublin. this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight. ba managed everything in a very professional manner. the bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules. the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video. during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression. i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.,yes
yes,"     london to paris. i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing. especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it. that being said, this is better than any low-cost carrier.",yes
yes,"     delivering outstanding customer service onboard. british airways may not have the cleanest, newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight  since i have flown with them.",yes
yes,"    this was a night flight new york jfk to london, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what i experienced was certainly not bad. i think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in first. but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin. the former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. it's irritating that they don't have any showers in the concorde room; i wasn't amused to check in at the galleries (business) lounge, be brusquely sent on to concorde, only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early august in nyc - of course i needed a shower!). departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. likewise, all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. all very courteous and professional. after such a long delay, i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. but the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this, i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). the cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. but it's certainly nothing special for first class. overall, a very acceptable flight, but i felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing (where can i have a shower in the morning? where will i be having breakfast?). i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects. ",no
yes,"     amman to london. appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. we are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. i had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). it turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with soya milk - the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh i don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". i had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. when she returned she said 'we don't provide that sort of thing."" that was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. so we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. the customer service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off. after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. so we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers. ",no
yes,"     paphos to london gatwick in club europe. we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in uk. we checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. we were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba, that no lounge access was available. the flight itself was ok, although two hours late. the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. on arrival at gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. ba has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case ba were lacking.",no
yes,"     gatwick to paphos in club europe. we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad. we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. we are used the ba's club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. service from the cabin crew was good. it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass. the meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried out. flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. very happy with the service.",yes
yes,"     
new york to nairobi via london. flight attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. but the business class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. the ife on the lhr-nbo leg reminds me of the game ""pong"" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. ba charges to select business class seats. for my family of 4, it would have cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments.",no
yes,"     istanbul to london heathrow. the plane itself was old, i found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be checked in for security purposes. this meant that when i was at ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks. 1 before check in, one after check in and one before getting on the plane. because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane. norwegian offers free wifi so i could check my phone on the plane. british airways need to improve their service levels.",no
yes,"     bad service and attitude all round. my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems. ba refused to rebook us at the airport, instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later. ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel, food and refreshment costs.  we were stranded at the airport, no help to find a hotel, zero customer care or empathy. premium prices for a ryanair style service. ",no
yes,"     london to santiago de chile. i was flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. the seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, i would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. however, lufthansa on the a380 (also y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). the seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which i chose to listen to some bbc concerts). the crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. the food was extraordinarily good (the chicken i had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). the frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. i didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).  i had a good experience with ba and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average). premium economy is a good value for money, especially on a 15 hrs flight.",yes
yes,"     flew a now ageing b777 flight ba 0053 to seattle. pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. ok choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded. comfortable seat but it's the old bug bear - 8 across with ""over the legs"" access to the aisle. fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this can't come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances, is it? absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system - although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... fa's great welcoming and gave good service. but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  not what i expect from a flag carrier airline. we refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. so, although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club, if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.",no
yes,"    flew london gatwick to tirana rinas. bag drop at gatwick was basically seamless, and ba was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. the flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. for which boarding had already started. boarding was pretty much seamless. the cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. the legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. good recline aswell. i don’t understand why british airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. and there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. flights were on time. flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. so overall, it’s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to murcia and back. a few problems at heathrow with the wrong gate being shown (ba ground staff didn't seem to care this was an issue) but the flights were excellent, comfortable and on time. i really don't mind paying for the food and drink inflight, especially as you can pay using avios. murcia airport also a joy. small, efficient and friendly. i will only fly ba on short haul in europe. very impressed.",yes
yes,"     london to amsterdam. ba's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. i should now be in amsterdam - however, i am still writing this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. we boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. shortly after, we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut, and no planes were taking off. about an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. one more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. after 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. we did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. we taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. the crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. this is the full extent of my praise though. little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come. ba's ground handling was attrocious. we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. however, ba had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". i have never heard anything like it. this is beyond unbelievable. no assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - i was told to consult the ba app the following morning. ba's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so i can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. i guess i'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. this is all simply appalling. we all understand that adverse weather happens. but to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. moreover, ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24-hour airports i do not know. and as for the ground handling, i have never had an experience this bad. ba staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for ba excuse"". i've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. by contrast, i don't see how ba could have handled this worse. they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.",no
yes,"     aberdeen to abu dhabi via london. despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airways these days and now i've reminded myself why. flight crew don't afford old fashioned courtesy or service. i'm not saying they are rude, just that they don't provide a decent level of customer service. you get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention. they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact. no bags at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with, however the way they deal with it is appalling. couldn't care less i feel. 3hr delay on return flights. seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender.",no
yes,"     prague to denver via london. i almost missed my flight because at check-in i had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes -  later, no one asked me for those papers. flight to heathrow was average, what you expect from a 2 hour flight. at heathrow the security lasted me  30 minutes. when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room, it was less than the flight before.  the flight then was pretty much okay, the food was delicious, had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks, the flight staff was kind and helpful. but the plane had no paid wi-fi, no outlets or usb ports, the screens were low quality.",no
yes,"     seville to gatwick. if it wasn't for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i would never fly ba given the current product. the cabin was old, cramped and dirty. the cabin crew were abrupt and surly. the buy-on-board is still a massive bug-bear - we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary.

",no
yes,"     i thought it time ba deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days. i was fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently. being able to check-in at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus as is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong. i found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time i flew long-haul with ba.. the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my one world status. ba has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'goswami' who found me a window seat for lhr-hkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow. all-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these days.",yes
yes,"     faro to gatwick. club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro. ba now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! it feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. it’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. whilst ba do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. once on board, i have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point i dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. i was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that i was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it. priority disembarkation and baggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly.",yes
yes,"     gatwick to faro. club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. the lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. the lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. as always the drinks offering in ba lounges was great. the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! on board was the usual club europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. ba don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. i would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",yes
yes,"     jeddah to chicago via london. the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasn't as good as i expected, ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude. also, the new baggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable, i had to check my carry-on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there, they took my laptop when i dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers. however, the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too. the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous.  i won't fly with ba again until they change their baggage restrictions for the saudi flights.",no
yes,"     london to frankfurt. i need to fly ba for business frequently, as i don't have other choices. not only planes are delayed (as today), but the lounges in heathrow are a joke. i don't use them anymore as they are overcrowded, and they don't serve proper food, just snacks. their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests. their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you.",no
yes,"    gatwick to malaga. when booking the tickets, i realised that by choosing certain flights in club the fare was cheaper than economy once i had added suitcases and pay for food onboard, i hadn´t flown ba club in europe for a while and was looking forward to it. i was nicely impressed. my outbound flight was a wet-lease by titan but this was the full ba service. the crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet. i was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks. the only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly.",yes
yes,     bermuda to gatwick. usual window and aisle seat taken. crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese (including sandwiches) not good when someone cannot eat cheese. breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the money paid. seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger's legs to get out from the window seat in the night.,yes
yes,"     aberdeen to boston via london heathrow. i found the seats weren't wide enough and leg room was restricted. on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move. also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests. otherwise they were good flights with, slightly odd choices, but decent food. extensive entertainment options/variety as well. ",yes
yes,"     london to hamburg. baggage self-check-in was diabolical ... machines were either slow or not working. boarding commenced early, resulting in on time departure. seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers. however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor. i don't expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been something. crew were friendly and the flight on time.",yes
yes,"    flew london heathrow to hong kong with british airways. flew premium economy and the experience was anything but. check yourself in, create and scan your own baggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself. unsurprisingly slow process, and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line. hardly a ba service attendant in sight. better service with ryanair, i hate to say it.",no
yes,"    flew to istanbul with british airways on 5th june. at the passport/visa check desk, presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady - my wife was holding the passports. the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked 'passports' as if she did not see my wife holding them. second bark: 'do you have a visa?'. third bark: 'show me'. fourth bark: 'next'. no smile, no 'hello' or 'good morning'. hardly any eye contact either. if anything, the situation was worse at boarding. ba recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. all such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. when caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'not yet'. some attempted to board prematurely more than once. on the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. accepting that the system must be monitored, ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english.",no
yes,     munich to london heathrow with british airways. i booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year. i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service. i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop. the check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly. he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too. the flight was on an a320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too. the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly. although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed. i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable. arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus. overall a very good experience with ba.,yes
yes,    wonderful service on the flight from edinburgh-florence on 7 july 18. mainline british airways could learn lots from ba cityflyer and their franchise partner in s africa (com air).,yes
yes,"    london heathrow to manchester. it was outrageous of british airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the 05/07. i bought, paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date. how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work (different airlines) until i encountered ba at heathrow. check-in and help desk are arrogant, rude and are as miserable as hell. not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from ba. british airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, like others i have found an alternative airline. i close my review and say i will never ever use british airways again. i would rather walk to manchester.",no
yes,     london to madrid. lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together.  i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i don’t want any particular seat. we are travelling as a pair. there are three seats each side of the aisle. there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit. ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don’t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this. ,no
yes,"     luggage broken into – no explanation. first the good point. cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba169 london to shanghai on 22 june. not so good. the bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement. the trust breaker. upon arrival in shanghai i was not the only one from ba169 reporting missing luggage. mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use. nothing was missing, so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage? people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state. ba have not provided any explanation despite queries to customer relations; this is not acceptable. corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff.",no
yes,"     london to tehran back in august 2017. the cabin looked so old and tired, i struggle to understand why ba has not updated yet on a lot of their b777 aircraft. the inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s, but the selection of movies was alright. the meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point. the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i wasn't even sitting in the last rows of the economy section.  the seats were very uncomfortable. a couple hours later there was another drinks service. ",no
yes,"     pisa to london heathrow. having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft. our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an a321 aircraft is standard seat pitch. why didn't ba notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight? once we'd boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room. the ba cabin crew did move my husband but said ""this happens all the time with row 22, it might be an exit row but it's not extra leg room"".",no
yes,"     i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to las vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded. the plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late. when we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around. the service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. the return flight was a disaster. the seats were dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, lauren perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason, some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great. when i complained i was offered 8,000 avios, are you serious ba? i think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british airways. unless a first class ticket on british airways is on sale, i would suggest you fly with another airline. british airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty - it’s about time they  had a deep clean and re-model the first class it’s getting so old, it’s like club class with a few tweaks.",no
yes,"     had four flights in total with this airline, first flight from dublin to london on 29th june 2018 was delayed by 2 hours. this delay would have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies). we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our bag. despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience). we are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out. seems like no one cares. this was our first and last experience of using ba.",no
yes,"     johannesburg to heathrow. british airways are not doing us proud. i recently flew back from south africa with some sports equipment. their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but i was charged £65 to bring my bike back. the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt. as i had to bring the bike back, i had no choice but to pay. when i got back i contacted their customer service, they are not willing to help.  also, the seats are getting really uncomfortable. the food is terrible. ",no
yes,"     the queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins. a more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop. excuses as i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. they could have just got more staff there to begin with. group boarding was super slow. inside the econ cabin, the plane seemed very old, and worn-out. the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. some of the flight attendants were unprofessional. meals were bad for me, the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good. they gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight. the wifi doesn't exist in the cabin.",no
yes,     british airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class. no co-ordination at airport and apparently not one ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to. had to call ba customer service in uk which was a waste of time. given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. advised stewardess but they did not care. could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. waste of time paying to go business class with ba.  they did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way.,no
yes,"     mumbai to edinburgh via london. i'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as i have always had a great experience with ba in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. after sales service can be a different experience! this flight i arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. she calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. i was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to premium economy and i am so glad i did. the service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. i thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. the food was ok, i've had worse, i've had better. but i was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. my connecting plane was late leaving heathrow to edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. all in all i'm glad i flew ba for this trip.",yes
yes,"     mumbai to london heathrow. disappointing experience. i wouldn't book business class again, felt like bad value for money. i've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. the staff weren't that attentive so i felt like i got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. i had one person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested. the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of money. i paid an extra £500+ for better food on a tray with cutlery. really not worth it!",no
yes,"     delhi to london. having read many negative reviews about british airways i boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. it is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline british airways is no different to other european airlines. as a resident of the netherlands i hear dutch people saying exactly the same about klm, their national airline, and french friends say the same about air france. the onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. the food was more than adequate. the in-flight entertainment was adequate too. i'm not sure if the extra one pays for economy plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. when we landed at heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably. they more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking.",yes
yes,"    when you travel british airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with british airways staff. right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. she spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. because i need special assistance they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. my wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. the guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. the cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's i have been on have 6. that means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. of course the 787 is a great aircraft. so for me the seat was below my expectation. i was also amazed that i had to pay £190 to reserve seats, i don't pay anything with other airlines. the food was just ok nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice. in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don't have snobs working for them.",no
yes,"     british airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to gibraltar was faultless. on time (early arrival in fact), smiling friendly crew, excellent hot meal and plentiful drinks. gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok. gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge.",yes
yes,"     ba first class is not even that any more. starting with the lounge in t3; this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t5, but it need not feel like a rural train station. poor food, average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facilities in fra or muc. there is no ground assistance, and boarding was haphazard. fine cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. the seat was ok, but not in the same class as the new ac j class pods, and not close to the emirate's suites. small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in f), seat comfort (ok, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). the crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery, but poor overall. ba, your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you, and your first class product is not worth the name anymore. one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product. and no wi-fi",no
yes,"     linate to london. the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled, with no specified reason. as an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid, then to palma, to arrive the next day in birmingham. disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england (and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator) and i was offered a flight in the evening at 1900, which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined. i had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to london in time, unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune. on top of it, since the flight would arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted, i had to pay the taxi £70 more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow. british airways did not take responsibility, i was not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference. they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused. the worst has been the answer of their customer care saying it was not their responsibility!",no

",no
yes,    i have flown british airways numerous times over many years. sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. we asked for the fish. after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. we were not given anything. the service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines. ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers.,no
yes,"    we can not fault the new 'club world' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! the food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. it's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. you now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get. the pillow is larger and tons better than before. can't believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in seattle and once home again. we do mainly club europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new club world will be a great success.",yes
yes,"     very disappointing experience - flew out on a 747 400 series (should be scrapped!) departed late. loaded aircraft ready for push back, no a/c temperature was excessively hot all flight, no cool air. personal media system broken, split screen. food quality diabolical. moody flight attendants, ran out of hand soap. return flight on a380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flight. been flying ba for over 25 years, probably would be a last choice in future - sad to see.",no
yes,"     calgary to london. cabin full. overhead locker full of blankets. seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently. take off about 1945 local time. evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. menu listed seasonal salad (leaf, one small piece of lettuce and cucumber), braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta, with butter pecan cake. only 3 beef meals available. choice was either pasta or to go hungry. i chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice. breakfast (a light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted of a cream cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later. we paid extra for world traveller plus but i consider that we were conned. customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing i received the following response, ""thanks for coming back to us. i completely understand why you’re disappointed we couldn’t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flight. i hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering. this meant they couldn’t provide a full meal service and i absolutely agree this isn’t what you would expect when you travel with us. i’m sorry we’ve let you down."" that is it. thank you ba. this is the last time we will ever book long haul with you.",no
yes,"     london to zurich. the airline isn’t bad. their boarding procedure was very good, though the aircraft was very old. i know it is one of the oldest, and personally i enjoyed it. but if i have to be realistic, it’s very old, loud and uncomfortable. the service isn’t good either, you don’t even get a cup of water. it’s great to hop to london, but don’t expect any kind of special treatment or service.",no
yes,"     glasgow to new york jfk via london. outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747. still i could see its age. we had a duo seat at the back of the plane. the plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head. the ife was decent and had a good selection. the cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us. flight left close to on time. service was quick as we were first served at the back. we were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. adequate amount of food served and was tasty. ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. we then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. it was ok. return flight from vegas was on a old 747. horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. ife was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice. i wouldnt fly ba again if i had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats. £210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive. also the planes they use are too old and tatty.",no
yes,"     flew on a last minute emergency trip london heathrow to baltimore with ba. most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new boeing 787. i found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft i have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, a340 and 747. ba needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation. this felt to me more like being crammed in to a boeing 737 on a transatlantic flight.",yes
yes,"     earlier this year, my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to jo'burg, returning from cape town, thru london in each direction. having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the a380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. we therefore had no choice. what sort of customer retention policy is this? no other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but ba just don't seem to care. it is a rip-off. the forward/rear facing business class seat plan on ba planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. ba should take a look at the emirates a380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. this was our first business class experience with ba. having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly, we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are.",no
no,"   los angeles to london. i booked with aa, lax to lhr round trip very far in advance. ba is aa partner. paid for the ba seat selection early to get good seats. ba canceled the flights (coming and going), ba did not inform aa or me that the flights were canceled. all of my text and phone number was entered with ba with my passport number. they should have contacted me. i found out a couple days before my flight because i happened to call to do a meal request. it turns out that ba shifted to smaller planes and i actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days i needed to catch up with a tour. all they said is we can't help you. i kept calling and calling and got seats on the days i needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, premium economy was awful. food was terrible. we had pre paid $276 to choose seats. there were no good seats left. we ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. same seats coming home. i would have been better off flying in coach. i have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. i tried to get this before my return flight started because i was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.they wouldn't refund. after returning, i made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing i could do. it is possible i may get a response in a month regarding my email request. don't ever fly with them! they used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. if you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. they have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. i spoke to many many supervisors, no results. there is no one to solve problems. they pass the buck, have you fill out forms online and no one responds.",no
no,"   the overall flight wasn't too bad. seats and everything was comfy enough, although my girlfriends television didn't work for either the outbound or inbound flight, and little effort was made for a resolution. i understand that it isn't the flight attendants fault,  but it would have been nice if a little more effort than 'there's nothing we can do' was given to the issue! on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30-40 minutes as the bridge 'wasn't where it should be' which once again wasn't the worst problem in the world but after a long flight isn't particularly what you wanted! it wasn't the best experience.

ba’s galleries lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. champagne was conspicuously lacking. toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. there were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. seats 62j/k on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. take off was on schedule. fas went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. the food was the worst we've ever experienced in club world. the 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. the white company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. there's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. landing was ahead of schedule. overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. british airways are falling ever behind their competitors.",no

yes,"    i took the new option of the new toronto to london gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. cheaper than the heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether i could fall back in love with gatwick. excellent check in at pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. goodness knows what ba were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. the premium plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. on time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). the cabin was a third full. juice and water offered. no prosecco in premium economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to london, but why champagne in biz is manageable. on time departure, and a fast drinks service. this is my first experience of gatwick crew. fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving heathrow. (and all over 25!) the meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. as the plane was empty, i went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. ife on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at christmas! an early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. returning, i liked the biz / first class check in area at lgw - fast and friendly. the lounge at gatwick was streets ahead of heathrow. self serve champagne and loads of seats. kept very clean and plenty of food. an upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. a really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from heathrow. the only thing that spoilt it was off duty ba staff in biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight, the gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in premium economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and i even liked gatwick!!",yes
no,"   first time flying with british airways in economy on a transatlantic flight from london to chicago. i was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly flight attendants. they walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. i will definitely fly british overseas again given a chance. the economy seats on this old but well kept boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and i am a 5'9"" x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped. i would encourage all my friends to fly british if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the us to europe. thank you british airways, very good service indeed.",yes
yes,"     geneva to vancouver via london. worst experience. terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism, they offered £25 voucher and no apology - an insult as did not ask for compensation. it's an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline. on a positive point the geneva to london flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to vancouver were abysmal.",no
yes,     this is the first time i have flown ba's club europe flying from london heathrow to corfu. i was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however i was very pleasantly surprised. shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. i had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. we were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. the crew were very attentive and helpful. they had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. the seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. this flight was an upgrade using avios and i would happily do it again. i paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which i think was very good value for what i had.,yes
yes,"     our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship. we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to london heathrow. this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick. i managed to get through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day. we were offered no other assistance by the airline. the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport. shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. the real horror of this flight, however, was british airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/avios. this simply does not work. after one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. about 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. i consider this to be completely unacceptable. if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airways, there is no point traveling with them. the budget airlines can do better at lower cost.",no
yes,"     hong kong to london. this was my first business class trip on ba, as i mostly use emirates or cathay pacific. in comparison, ba offers a very low standard. the flight attendant who served the section where i was seated couldn't have cared less. no greetings when passengers boarded the plane, no offer of help. he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink. no second drink was offered. the toilet hadn't been cleaned properly before boarding, and during the flight, one of the two washrooms became unusable, resulting in long queues. the seating arrangement - having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction- is uncomfortable. overall, appalling quality and little value for money.",no
yes,"     washington to bucharest return via london. i was originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles check-in was offered a club world upgrade at just $499 more which i accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. the two london-bucharest sectors both went well. but all this was just a prelude to my return trip. while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. at the bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which i accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. on arrival in london i was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade (this time for free). once on the plane back to washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how i was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items i really can't eat but ultimately i still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. they were as professional and proactive a crew as i've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. finally, once arrived at dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. what could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years i've had mostly excellent experiences with ba cabin crews and that's a big reason why i've stayed with ba all these years and will continue to do so. but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you're the best.",yes
yes,"     london to warsaw. ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline. the price of seat selection still remains high. the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2-hour flight.  you can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever someone is moving. i didn't buy any food or drink onboard, although i reckon it's not badly priced. the inbound flight was on an older a320, in which the seat was reclining. ",no
yes,"     london to istanbul. due to poor weather conditions at lhr, the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable. when the passengers were informed of the gate, everyone gathered at the 'a' gate in t5. then, no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own. next, there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate. everyone rushes to the one of the last of the 'c' gates. once on board, the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour. the flight finally takes off nearly three hours late. after a while, the crew comes with the m&s gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and i had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner. the flight arrived in istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury, the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal. ",no
yes,"     london to cape town. flying first class with british airways is a hit-or-miss affair. but having secured a couple of return flights to cape town with avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. unfortunately, terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and galleries first lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. the food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. boarding was on time and according to ba's new group allocation. our seats - 2k and 3k - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. but seats a and k are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. however, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. the ife is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. but at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast. landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes. overall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane.",yes
yes,"     london to hamburg. typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr. this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg. using their avios points i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the american premium class (not) lounge. all the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge. the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. people jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. boarding was like a cattle call. ba flies one of its oldest b747 into miami and it showed even in first. the seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. the service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of california. the flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what i did for my connection to hamburg. in the end i decided i was done with ba because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines. try using ba points on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.

yes,"     los angeles to london heathrow. desperately poor service from british airways in club class. business class is utterly outdated, with the weird ""facing each-other configuration"", and narrow / uncomfortable seats. the food served was appalling. the cabin crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. the problem with british airways now in first and business class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoever. poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, no wifi and an overall budget airline experience. british airways even charge for seat selection too, which adds insult to injury. avoid this horrible airline if you can. the only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful, quiet airbus a380. a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude.",no
yes,"     london heathrow to mahon. booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. pre-booked seats at the same time. i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to madrid on the 26th may” when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca. airline assured me everything was fine. further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). an urgent call to ba i was told 1) i was probably being moved to a bassinet position. when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which i now understand is also incorrect. my concern was well placed. at ba t5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and i had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ after kicking up a huge fuss (i believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. as this was my sons first ever flight, i was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, i even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. conclusion is families avoid at all costs.",no

yes,"     outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent ife system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to premium economy. return flight ba 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the pe cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? the cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the ife system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched i doubt i would have been able to watch anything. cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the captain we departed. the evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and g&t was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll. i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. ba this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again.",no
yes,"    singapore to london. this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380. now this aircraft, in qantas colours, is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf. as mentioned in my review of ba16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. the same comments for that review apply here. the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content. on qantas, american, cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (godfather, gladiator, brave-heart, roman holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. some smart edgy team in soho, london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. ife is one thing on long haul. the other is food and beverage. the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly. on qantas (say qf1 from singapore to london) one gets the evening meal service, followed by weiss ice cream, a lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such. i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. one guy looked like steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. that is sad given the stature of ba. i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply. hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",no
yes,"    sydney to london via singapore. it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours. last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002. the years have not been kind to ba. probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines. nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380, occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines. the problem is not the hard product. a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine. nosier than the a380 but that is well known. very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home. it is the soft product that is lacking. check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security (being a gold ff with qantas). boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore. now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. no menu given showing what was to be served (as with cathay, emirates and qantas). the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap. kfc offers a better grade of plastic. i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas). the food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. it's just the quality that is lacking. drinks? i have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke. this is available on qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. a note about the fa's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. final word about this leg is the ife. a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. one or two interesting things and some new releases. come on ba, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. as for music: well i'm 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world. we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters. if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago.",no

yes,"     washington to prague via london. i have flown them several times in the past, but not for a number of years. i remember them as not a ""top of the line"" airline, but better than average. this time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airline. you pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. the seating on the boeing 787 seemed very cramped. it is said to be 31"" but seemed like less. on the return flight on may 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. the a320 from london to prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. they may be the new ""slimline"" seats, i'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. also, on the washington  to lhr flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. the agent at washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. it was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. i won't say that i will not fly them again, but i will definitely compare prices in the future. they aren't worth any extra cost.",no

yes,"     london to montreal. i did my online check-in the night before and left to go to the airport. i arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn't working, so i proceeded to the ba counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. i was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. the line we were moved to was substantially longer however i was patient. by the time i got to the desk, an hour had passed, and i had a bit over an hour left to my flight. i figured this was tight but all the while manageable since i trusted ba's system. the woman at the counter asked me where i was going and when i said montreal, she looked at me and said ""you won't make it"". i explained the situation how i had been in the airport for several hours already and that i was in line for 1 hour. she just told me i needed to go to the missed flight counter. i got to the counter and they informed me that i had to buy a new return ticket. my original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  i had no choice but to buy the ticket. i also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to gatwick airport the following morning. once i arrived back in montreal i called ba customer services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that i could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight i missed. imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500 cad all in. when i escalated my complaint, they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you, and that was that. ",no
yes,"     tokyo to amsterdam via london. on the evening before departure i received an email from ba the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. in the end the aircraft left tokyo haneda with a 90 minutes delay. baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with japanese politeness. if you have the choice to fly from nrt or hnd i would definitely choose hnd because it's much more conveniently located to downtown tokyo. the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. i didn't like the seats on the 777. i found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. on the window and aisle seats, there's also the ife box so there's no place for both feet. the meal was a joke and there was no choise. inflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightness. the crew was not very friendly. when i went to the galley for a drink i was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. the second meal service was rushed. we've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to lhr.  luckily i've made it to my connecting flight to amsterdam because i had a short connection. the a320 flight to amsterdam departed ahead of schedule. there's nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice. unfortunately ba decided to cut the the service on european flights in the race to the bottom.",no
yes,    check-in at vienna airport was painless. ba uses air lounge at vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay. boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to club europe passengers. the flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. i found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. the food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches. one passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. business class was quite average to be honest. will fly club europe again maybe depending on which route and price. ba has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within europe.,yes
yes,"    took a day trip to vienna with british airways, booked at the last minute. flying out at 0720 on a sunday and having an early start to get to the airport i was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. having never usually been a problem, i boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket, to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business. freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep – another example of ba’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. despite it being one of the first flights out of heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into vienna – quite as to how, is beyond me. i'll be sticking to easyjet until british airways once again starts to value it’s passengers, as currently they couldn’t care less.",no
yes,"     glasgow to heathrow. ba are a disgrace, it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high. my flight from islay was delayed by 2 hours, no fault of mine, so i missed my connecting flight! after being fobbed off as not my fault, nothing we can do i ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again, i had to pay for another flight. money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling",no
yes,"     london to phoenix this week. having a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and rest. this was successful on the flight with 6 hours slept which was super comfortable which i was surprised at. the meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for ba. the poorest part of the trip is the tv being so small and picture so poor. in the end, couldn't really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues i.e. press pause and film would start from beginning. would i fly again, sure why not.",yes
yes,"     glasgow to heathrow. very disappointed in british airways. having been delayed by a ""partner airline"" and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve, ba charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning. their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my ba exec club membership so i'd had to book it as two flights. neither ba or loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night. clearly, being a member of the ba exec club counts for nothing. very bad customer service ba. seems ba and loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers.",no
yes,"     brussels to shanghai via london heathrow. all flights on time, clean aircraft, food good, cabin crew friendly.  i recommend british airways. the only complaint i have is about the ground staff at heathrow. i lost my jacket on the shanghai to london flight and ground staff at heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects.",yes
yes,"     chicago to london heathrow. i was dubious about flying ba especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which i left the aircraft feeling very hungry. however my trip to usa with ba was surprisingly very good both ways. on this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, i was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. although i slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of mecca so i could pray (in my seat). was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. a380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although i noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey. for dinner there was butter chicken, rice and lentils, and a rice pudding type desert, all of which was okay - nothing special.",yes
yes,"     athens to philadelphia via london. i chose ba because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ath to lhr they do not serve food and beverages free. on the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats, there was no waste envelope, whilst my inflight magazine was so overused. lhr to phl an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way, rather poor lunch. i was disappointed with ba especially with their decision to charge for f&b on european flights.",no
yes,"     hong kong to london heathrow on b777 in club world. this was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to hk on an a350 on cathay pacific and the difference was huge. the ba club world cabin is very cramped when compared with cathay. the seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. the duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. they also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. the food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough. drinks selection was very good. plus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humour. understand ba plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough.",no
yes,"     los angeles to london heathrow return.  outbound first class, return club world. a380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. firstly, ba flight deck crews are awesome. totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  the cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. their service was excellent. i wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and i didn’t eat anything, so i can’t comment on the food. on the return flight, in club world, the food was very good, no complaints there. the seats were comfortable although the club world cabin felt cramped. i was in 53k which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. as it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but i think it would be an issue on night flights. i hope ba change their business class seating for something like aa business class on their 777-300s. ba business class is really dated, and i said it felt cramped. my big issue, and this isn’t entirely ba’s fault was the over zealous security screening at heathrow. i was pulled aside for screening 3 times. i don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive. i am enrolled in and pay for tsa pre check and if british airways would participate in this program, it would save a lot of angst. other than that, the overall ba experience was totally acceptable.",yes
yes,"     hamburg to abu dhabi via london. hamburg to heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candy. everything is for purchase, i felt cheated. heathrow terminal 5 was a big mass. getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal! security screening was extremely slow and staff rude. i will avoid heathrow in the future. long flight to abu dhabi was ok, no frills in premium economy but edible food. return flight was similar, but heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time. my last flight on ba was over 30 years ago, it was a real premium carrier then.

yes,"     overnight club world flight from rio to london. check in at rio was efficient. third party lounge (premium plaza) which was reasonable and had enough space. no fast track security lanes in rio. plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding. on board, standard club world service. my feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be. granted they only loaded one of the wine options (which was wasn't great either). food itself not terribly appetizing. breakfast quite rushed, which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight. flight landed on time, priority bags worked and were off quickly. an average experience. however, ba were not the lowest cost option on this route (at the time of booking that was air france- a carrier i rate highly), but they were a direct flight.",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to vancouver. the 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft, even though i paid for premium economy the seat was hard, small and uncomfortable, it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back, the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off. the touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working. the washroom had a leak and when i used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks, the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said i shouldn’t have worn socks. there was no accessory pack of eye shades etc, out of two meal choices one had run out after two rows had been served. the  crew appeared bored and not bothered.",no
yes,"    madrid to london. credit where it's due. flew club europe and the crew were excellent. friendly, attentive and professional. the food was a good standard. the b767 has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats. think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service.",yes
yes,"    venice to gatwick. i use snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened together to allow skiers to check in one bag only. in feb of this year, i was told by ba check in staff in venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together. the staff were clear that it is ba policy that bags cannot be fastened together. for nearly three months i have been asking the ba complaints team to provide evidence of this baggage policy. i have had several replies in that time but on each occasion, the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in venice. ba has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact ba employees or employed by a third party. this is very disappointing in what was a reputable company.",no
yes,"    first 3 legs were trouble free. lounges were good, some staff were good, some were very poor, especially the agent i encountered at security in lhr. my flight from singapore was delayed in the air and i was not allowed onto my connecting flight. british airways re-booked me on the next flight, but downgraded me from business to economy and into a centre seat. fine, i wanted to get home and they said they would compensate me. after 3 weeks, they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket, but i was not entitled to any even token gesture of frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat, after a long haul flight. i missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep. it was all handled very poorly, late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via air france or one of the middle east carriers who value my business. its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and i will certainly look at flying with other carriers now.",no
yes,"    flew london to budapest with british airways. massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like ryanair or easyjet with no real added value. no drinks or food served on the flight, the check-in process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well. a bit more legroom but that won’t justify the £200 price difference on a 2hr flight.",no
yes,"     paid for a vueling airlines flight from florence to gatwick and bumped off flight. when called, british airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though i bought the ticket from ba.com and had one flight number ba2058. a shocking attitude towards their paying customer.",no
yes,"    london to sao paulo. overnight club world flight. prompt check in at heathrow and into lounge. no spaces at the spa, galleries lounges were fine and showers clean. good wifi. aircraft was a 777-300 so in flight entertainment was good. they also had wifi on board. crew experienced and were good. service prompt, food reasonable and i liked the new white company offerings. flight arrived early. generally a solid performance.",yes
yes,"    worst ba flight ever! flew tampa to london gatwick. no greeting by the door, shown to economy despite business seat. dirty plane. bits dangling from the ceiling. only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced, which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier. probably the worst business class seat around, wobbly footrest, facing strangers and having to climb over people. breakfast was a single, meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup. at disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers, that was left to other passengers. crew just stood there. economy was not held back, so no priority disembarkation. never again.",no
yes,"    flew british airways from london heathrow to dusseldorf. despite being row 1, legroom was tiny. no comparison to say eurowings, which is a budget airline. food terrible. even worse was the seat. this is not business class, one expects a degree of comfort. next time i will fly eurowings and get decent leg room, with a table i can actually work on.",no
yes,"     madrid to london. the main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly, and hard working. the i saw no food in the iberia lounge at madrid, no working washrooms, and discourteous iberia staff. the food on board was ludicrous, in business i got a panini - the staff looked embarrassed to serve it. waste of money. ",no
yes,"     london to moscow. british airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in business class is no longer club world (flat bed) seat but club europe seat (not flat bed). it is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. i cannot fly during the day as i have meetings scheduled. ba has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that ba is offering during the day. they also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like friday when the seat (whether club world or club europe) is less important as saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. in summary it is unacceptable that ba is charging more for the flights with club world seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change. this was never the case before and ba was fair previously.",no
yes,"     miami to london. my most recent ba experience was positive. i fly ba for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year. on my most recent flight from miami to lhr i found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400. which to me is the legend of the skies! the cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service, from the mia ground handling american crew. food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29e generous for my long legs. i recently flew ba business/ club world to the far east for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight. well done ba you excel against the north american carriers on routes to the north american gateways who give just a basic service.",yes
yes,"     gatwick to barbados in december 2017. on a 9 hour flight they provided one meal, and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars bar and a cup of tea. the plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surly. the only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors (but still not cheap).",no
yes,"     london heathrow to dallas. the aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. the personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so i had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. the choice of ife is very limited. the food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. i saw some passengers request for more food, and i was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. i must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from jfk. i had an onward connecting flight with american airlines, and i can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. whilst aa is improving, ba is becoming a national embarrassment. ba remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. the seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. it no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star. it's not even worth redeeming avios points anymore. these days i'd rather spend my avios on partner airlines.",no
yes,"    decided to go in club europe for this relatively short flight (90 minutes) from london to copenhagen. dropped my bags and went through security, which did not take too long. i then went to the galleries lounge (south), and although i have not been there for a year or two, it looked the same. same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. my gate was just around the corner, and i got on the plane. i like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. the food service was disappointing. the service in the cabin was ok, but not very warm. i have travelled a lot with ba over the past 20 years, after yesterda i have lost my faith in british airways.",no
yes,"    ba used to be a byword for quality and service. you simply can’t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. i paid 600 dollars for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba. for that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flight. also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your ipad). oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however turkish airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. pegasus and atlasglobal offer a similar service to ba but at far lower prices. it seems to be the same all over. ba used to be a first choice but at this price, for this service, it’s become a last resort.",no
yes,"    premium economy worse than most airlines economy. unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. these “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not ba. even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. this was the second leg on a flight from sydney (via lax) so we were beyond tired. when an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “you’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. in my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with norwegian, air new zealand and american airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. i’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with british airways, i’ve never had a good experience.",no
yes,"    flew belfast to london with british airways. stressful day started with a 2.5 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am. as an apology, they sold us the food and the drinks, yes they asked for money, even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours! seriously, if you can find an alternative to travel within the uk do it. not very countable if you have a connected flight!",no
yes,    naples to gatwick. the online check-in would not work for me in accordance with the one world frequent flyer policy. i am a qantas frequent flyer and so i ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. the ba website would not let me do so. the bag-drop in naples was slow and seemed rather random. boarding was tedious. i should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. in the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. the cabin crew were quite indifferent. i greeted 2 cabin crew when i boarded and neither of them smiled back. i bought a marks and spencer drink at an inflated price. one of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when i went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. disembarkation was slow and badly managed. nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers. ba has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag i will not be using them again in a hurry.,no
yes,"    i have been flying with ba for the last 32 years between sao paulo and london on and off but mostly ba. i have travelled in all classes except first. ba used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. not value for money. the food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in business (i flew out club and returned economy plus). staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. service is not exclusive anymore. seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on club. their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. it is a shame singapore airlines doesn't fly to brazil from the uk as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. ba has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and i feel it is time for the ceo to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. the changes on baggage weight has become silly also. i was allowed two luggages of 23kg. any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as i haven't go above the allowance i am entitled. instead i had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. in my opinion unnecessary as i had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! so i will in future re-think my trips to brazil. even if i have to make my journey longer as i am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. thumbs down to ba.",no
yes,"    i traveled on british airways with my wife from dallas to lagos, nigeria via london on february 23, 2018. i had an extra bag that i paid $200 for in dallas, our flight got delayed in dallas, therefore we missed our flight to lagos. when we got to london, we went to the ba counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a virgin atlantic flight to lagos. on getting to virgin atlantic counter, we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from ba, we decided to do that. i opened a case on ba website, explaining what happened and requested for a refund, as what happened was their fault and not mine. they refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy, i know this, but what happened was not my fault, but theirs. that was the last time i heard from them on the issue, even the economy premium was a waste of money, nothing special, such a disappointment, never again!",no
yes,"    flew british airways from budapest to london heathrow. quite possibly the worst flight i have ever had (and i travel often). generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it's more convenient for other passengers too. my partner and i had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. as more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. the flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""i'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. reducing our leg room to zero. how is this at all fair? i questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that i would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. i have no idea who at ba thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". the general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. what a sad state of affairs. i will never ever travel british airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. i would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct british airways flight.",no
yes,"    the air conditioning didn’t work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot. i had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler. it was an 8 hours flight from london heathrow to new york jfk. overall the airplane was old with little space to seat. there was no wi-fi. the leg/seating space was very small. i wish that food would be more taste neutral. if your child doesn’t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would be nothing to eat. the stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding. landing was smooth. the ba staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on. there are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in, and these boxes are very small. also the airport security was overly zealous - they had to search kids bag, and they found roll-on deodorant and checked it for fumes.

yes,"     my bag was damaged on a ba flight in december 2017. all looked good when i got to the airport customer services counter - was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call. i called this number when home and it's a 3rd party company called k2. they will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used. i raised this with ba who refused to offer like-for-like replacement. i got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later i decide that something is better than nothing and call k2, to get the bag they offered me, only to find that ba have closed my case and they won't send one. finally get through to ba and they finally agree to put me back to k2 to get the bag offered. if i want to upgrade what they offer i will have to pay it myself. i wont hold my breath but it is supposed to arrive on tuesday. i would not fly again unless i had no other viable option.",no
yes,"    efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight. decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from london heathrow to cairo. galleries south lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good. showers clean and well presented. chaotic boarding. well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. slightly delayed departure time made up en route. unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. happy with whole experience. i don’t think i would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you don’t need to sleep it was fine.",yes
yes,"     st lucia to gatwick. as this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and i now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. the cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. why in this day and age do ba persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? not that i could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. on top of this there was no usb point to charge my phone! i expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - i certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier. all in all it was an education, certainly taught me a lesson!",no
yes,"     fort lauderdale to gatwick. an efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals (terminal 1) to the international terminal (terminal 4). check-in was friendly. security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. club world was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. take-off was on time. the wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. drinks and food service served efficiently. food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of turkish airlines. seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat. abbreviated breakfast (no hot option) served an hour before landing. arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule. overall, an adequate flight, but the inflight experience was well below ba's competitors.",no
yes,"     dubai to london heathrow. it's bad that ba requests additional payment to select seats before the check-in. if flying solo it's not a big issue, but with any companion (in this case i was with my son of 10) it would have been an issue to be separate. this also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. on board service was decent. professional, courteous and friendly attendants. toilets in the second half of the flight weren't too clean. flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep. the aircraft did not have wifi.",yes
yes,"    london to las vegas. disappointed at ba - flights were delayed (my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 2-3hrs). aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space. no safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this. food was tasteless and i did skip a meal in the end - during one of the snack times we weren't given the options by our fa but the guy sat next to us who was served by another fa was given different options. inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old. to ensure that i sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke ife box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.  learnt our lessons, next time we will not fly ba!",no
yes,"     tampa to gatwick. i am a disabled traveller with considerable mobility issues. as i usually travel alone i can find it extremely difficult. however, from the moment i arrived at the check in desk in tampa i was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance. from the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional. i was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door. every person was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible. i witnessed such kindness and this is what i have come to expect and value from british airways. having used other airlines in the past - i am converted - i will not use any other airline in future.",yes
yes,"     heathrow to keflavik. i had booked economy, was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when i checked in online.  priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range. the inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine. off loading was straightforward. the return flight was on time, the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat. m&s food service was ok. the cabin crews were slow at taking payment. overall similar experience to an easyjet flight.",yes
yes,"     london to muscat first class. first time trying out first class on ba. check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass. concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa. onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. upon entering the first class cabin, i had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. i did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality. unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the tv. soon after take off, i was informed i could eat when i like. arabic starter was great. had pre-selected main meal online. meal was of good quality and cooked well. had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese i've had in some business class). surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, i imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. after finishing the one film i decided to watch, i decided to try get some sleep. crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. i missed breakfast, as i was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. overall, i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. the crew were very friendly and professional. given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.",yes
yes,"     my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the 10th march 2018. we have a 1 year old and a 4 year old. once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. as it was a night flight, my wife and i had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn't receive this. the flight was the worst airline experience we've had. i doubt i'll ever fly with ba again.",no
yes,"     gatwick to madeira. the flight left on time and arrived early, slept as early morning flight. the plane was not very clean, grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. the staff were pleasant. breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. the return was poorly organised, no use of fast track security for business class passengers. long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. really no point in paying for business class. the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment, dog-eared magazines.  quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration.",no
yes,"    london to casablanca. their customer service quality in heathrow terminal 3 is very patchy. for background, my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to ba. my second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting tap to rebook me, ba took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my 4th flight - i was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the 3rd flight. i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked. however, later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba. this is very rude and extremely unprofessional. i've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and low cost carrier.",no
yes,"    british airways flight manager is very professional. i travelled on ba985 from berlin to hong kong via london on 19 feb. due to the snowy weather, my flight leaving berlin to london was delayed, in which i was worried about missing my connecting flight from london to hong kong. during the flight, the manager came to me several times, explained to me the reason of flight delay, informed me about the connecting flight arrangements. her information was very clear, trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this. very much appreciated for their service.",yes
yes,    hyderabad to brussels via london. didn't expect this from british airways. for me quality hit the rock bottom. especially the unclean flight. i would have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel. maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think it's not worth it. other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british airways.,no
yes,"    london gatwick to fort lauderdale is one of ba's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. from september 2018, the gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced club world. the 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the club world cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution ife that required the usual rebooting. but there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved club world food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at fort lauderdale terminal 4. overall, an entirely reasonable flight.",yes
yes,"     milan to london heathrow. the service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at ba i am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passion. the response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane.
",no
yes,"     london to helsinki, business class, friday 23rd march. i thought service in the sky had died out. as a frequent flyer i haven’t felt the needed to complain nor commend until now. i had to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights i have ever had. this is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel. cabin staff made me feel like i was the only person they were serving. i loved the humour, the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes. ",yes
yes,"     london heathrow to denver. words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure i was comfortable on my latest flight; but here it goes! i was very sick/nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off british airways literally nursed me back to health. they were beyond wonderful and were genuinely caring and concerned. i never once felt like a burden, even though they were checking on me often! world class crew!! again, so thankful for people like this, especially in my time of need and would highly recommend this airline to everyone.",yes
yes,"    it was a 13 hours flight from heathrow to kuala lumpur with british airways, and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served. during the dinner, i was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake. for the breakfast, the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals (up until 40 minutes before landing, they were still serving), i waited for my turn but no food came so i asked. instead of them explaining and apologising, i had to ask where is my food. they said that they ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. the cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which i have filled in. while i understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and i liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. also, it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew (i thought they should have their own?). it was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes, and out it came a cabin crew. very interesting experience.",no
yes,"     worst business class i flew, you are facing a stranger for the entire flight. also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me, i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face. dreadful food, a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staff. the bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food. they also ran out of the appetiser. i was told sorry, we ran out of satay, and other passengers have already ordered them. therefore, please select another option. ",no
yes,"     beijing to london. service at the british airways business class counter at beijing airport was pleasant. the business lounge was quiet when we were there, however, food options were very limited, we were there in the morning, the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options. onboard, service was really good, quite personal and attentive, which made a difference from the service on the way out to beijing. food was as good a you'd expect to get on board, i managed to get a window seat, which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board. entertainment options were good.",yes
yes,"     london to beijing. left from t5 at heathrow, service is very speedy, you can use the fast track entrance which is swift. i didn't think much of the business lounge, food was more like canteen food, we were there around lunchtime, i ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps, later around 3pm they brought out some sandwiches, this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime. there were many drinks available, wine was ok. i tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working, this was also disappointing. with regards to the service on board the flight, it was ok, however, they collected my breakfast card, but not my husbands, so he nearly missed out on breakfast, the next morning, they offered my husband a bread roll, but not me, it seemed there was not much structure to the service, which meant they missed things. the entertainment that was available was good.",yes
yes,     bangkok to london. the worst long haul carrier i have flown with. a very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy. the flights served the worst food. the boeing 777 i flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices. the seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey. meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hours. when i mentioned to the onboard staff i was hungry i was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful. the dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens.,no
yes,"    food on this 4+ hours flight from moscow to heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of tea/coffee. the other london-moscow flights provide a full meal. the cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers. when the flight touched down, it was 75 minutes before we disembarked, 6 british airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator. my email to their ceo produced nothing except a plastic apology, even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation. used to be ba was a world leader. they've followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction.",no
yes,"    flew london heathrow to delhi airport. terminal 5 concorde room is impressive, clean but lacks service. had to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend. when boarding the plane - no one to escort you to the seat. as you know there are only 8 first class seats in b787-9. when it comes to meal choice, the main course i had selected (non veg indian dish) was not available. when questioned why? - i was told, ""sorry, today we only loaded 3 of those dishes, and other passengers have already ordered them. therefore, please select another option"". so, i skipped the main meal. i reminded the stewardess that i am not an upgrade passenger, i paid full price. it is shame that ba is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengers. i have never faced this situation with virgin or emirate, and have decided never to fly with ba if i can help.",no
no,"two regular an uneventful flights. curiously enough, though, with the exact same crew! the crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite, but i just cannot take it that british airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers, where everything is charged for, apart from luggage. on the second leg of the trip, the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason, row 6 where i was sitting did not have ac.",no
yes,"    london to belfast. another regular flight by british airways, which has turned into a low cost airline, given the total no frills service they provide. the staff are extremely nice and polite, but in the short haul flights you only get luggage. the flight went perfectly, departing and arriving on time.",no
yes,"    very full flight on g-bnlp/b747 flying from miami to london. according to basource.com this plane was built in 1990. obviously, since then it was not refurbished. felt like a teenager again. worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirty. additonally, the ife did not work. at the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. as the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. no ife and no book reading possible. crew were young and friendly, but obviously not experienced. took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after take-off - they skipped our last four rows. only after inquiring we got a tray. on arrival, new contractor at terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available. needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. overall, poor experience with british airways. they used to be good, but they try to be low-cost and charge legacy carrier prices. will not work. to fly, to serve is no more adequate as their slogan.",no
yes,"    warsaw to london. waw is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control “bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport. ba have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. seat in club europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. the service was very good, attentive and prompt. the food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected.",yes
yes,"     i booked my flight with cathay pacific,  the route between stockholm and london was operated by british airways. for a 2.5 hour flight, they do not offer anything free on board, there was no individual screen or usb charge at the seat for this short european flight.",no
yes,"    flew british airways from lisbon to london heathrow. uneventful flight. the crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. they should smile and be a little more considerate. however, the check-in lady was nice and we had a laugh. my problem with ba, for a while now, is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights.",no
yes,"    singapore to heathrow. i skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal. the air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came. when i asked another air steward for a bottle of water, he told me they don't have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal. was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight?",no
yes,"     chicago to chennai via london. the pilot and captain were top class - the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours - but they made it up to 2 hours and was smooth. chicago check in staff unfriendly, it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us. the only thing they tried was to upsell me into first class. meals - excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business.  my co passenger asked for a menu - answer - you are booked for veg meal - so that will be served. he asked for drinks menu - answer - ""what do you want?""  the seat was claustrophobic,  closed and uncomfortable. the crew was unsmiling.",no
yes,    flew london heathrow to toronto. i am a frequent traveller but this was the first time i have traveled with british airways and it did not disappoint me. the flight departed on time and caused no extra delays whatsoever despite the dreadful weather conditions in toronto. the cabin crews were wonderful and the service were great. the seat aren't the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too.,yes
yes,    i flew british airways from heathrow to hong kong in club world on a a380. they have recently introduced the new club world service on this route and it was a complete disaster. it took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight. they ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. the cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new ba concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight). i am gold on ba and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future.,no
yes,"    i flew british airways from miami to heathrow on an airbus a380. the premium economy cabin is located on the upper deck. i had a side seat with no one sitting next to me. boarding was smooth and we left on time. food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which i didn't eat, my dog liked it when i got home. for the price, you would expect a better meal. ife was fine. crew good.
",yes
yes,"     london to phoenix. decided to pay to travel first class for a big birthday. upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in i was disappointed to see no separate check in. just a young girl with a couldn't care less attitude behind a temporary room divider. off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. the lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. on board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. our return in club from new orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. i love ba onboard crew in general but i will never fly ba again.",no
yes,"    london to istanbul. flying in ba's club europe is a miserable experience, and i think they have the lowest standard of all european airlines. the seats are economy class seats, with no legroom; the only difference is that the middle seat is kept free. service and food are mediocre. when will ba get its act together and return to acceptable standards?",no
yes,"    i have traveled several times with british airways, but only in long haul trips. those have been pretty good. this time i had to fly from edinburgh to london gatwick and i end up with mix feelings. ground service in edinburgh was outstanding. expeditious, friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge. service on board was average but friendly. departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier, so very well. the plane was an airbus 319 in pretty good shape, clean and well maintained, however the space between seats was simply ridiculous. it was extremely small even for a midsize person. there would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work. happily the person in front of me did not recline, that could have been a disaster. very bad. of course there was no entertainment. there was food and beverages for purchase. due to the space between seats i would avoid flying with ba in short haul flights.",no
yes,"    could british airways get any worse? flew chicago - london heathrow in upper deck / club world, of ancient b747-400, british airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. the seats are the crazy / odd facing each other, with a rude screen, and are terribly uncomfortable / narrow. they must be at least a decade out of date. the food / wine was simply awful, and they didn't have the lamb on the menu, but replaced it with some kind of beef mush. the crew were young, uneducated, and unprofessional. they were waiters and waitresses at best, and didn't seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people. club class on this route was also full of screaming children, one of whom threw up on the flight. why do ba hold their premium customers in such contempt? i can give you the answer: they have a monopoly from the uk to the usa, and back, and no legitimate competition. ",no
yes,"    flew on british airways from athens to london. the aircraft was a boeing 757. at the age of 20 years, the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating. apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time. unfortunately ba has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but i guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive.",yes
yes,"    the best thing about this flight from london heathrow to miami was it’s punctuality. however having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich. only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady. aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age. screen tiny, scratched and hardly worth looking at. we have flown similar routes on thomas cook and tui planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this ba flight, which i think is shameful for the national carrier.",no
yes,"     i've been flying to bombay for the last seven years to teach there. for most of those seven years i have flown jet, but decided to try ba this time. terminal 5 heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate. boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded. logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when i questioned one of the staff, i was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  the flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than jet's, the food good, and the service great. the steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative. in economy class, i can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff. i can book the seat of my choice earlier if i wish to pay, and that was what i wanted to do with my avios points, but you cannot.  i was told that several executive club members and avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that ba might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with avios points. ba, judging from this experience, does not know whether it is a full-exercise or a low-cost airline. ",yes
yes,"    flew short haul business class with british airways, manchester - gothenburg via london heathrow. it's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. we used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full ba business short haul fee. we have family in sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. the staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. we had a mixture of fortunes with the catering man-lhr, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). lhr-got three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the m&s menu in economy either. one reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. i was told to change my profile details on ba site - once home i looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. we were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! any newspapers also gone from business class. on lhr-got route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. lounges ok - preferred man to lhr (which is busy and looking worn already). the down-scaling of ba and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. the fas were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. we'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.",no

yes,"    a fairly average flight to cape town and return. the old 777s they use out of gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. the tv screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is ok. the food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with british airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. as always with ba the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude. however i would probably still choose ba to cape town in order to fly direct.",no
yes,"     las vegas to london heathrow. really poor food, i am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he wouldn't eat what we were served. the breakfast wrap of turkey bacon or mushroom and spinach. they both smelt revolting and i didn't even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldn't eat anymore. chicken curry was questionable or again spinach lasagne - just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn't mean they what spinach with every meal, there are some very nice alternatives out there. we were not offered tea or coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive. i would think twice before traveling with ba again. i thought they were meant to be our flagship airline.",no
yes,"    flew ba 1311 on february 10th, from aberdeen to london heathrow. check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process. i really like the new group boarding structure. the lunch offered on board was good. cabin crew were very attentive. we arrived in london heathrow terminal 5 approx. 10 minutes ahead of schedule, however it took my luggage over 25 minutes to arrive. overall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage.",yes
yes,"     dusseldorf to london. very satisfied with ba, reasonable fares, on time, awesome cabin staff, going to the uk they are my favourite airline. in club europe i miss better seating and more leg room as first priority for business.",yes
yes,     orlando to gatwick. the flight was ok but let down by utterly appalling food. the chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour. it was mainly just rice. the biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? bizarre and ridiculous. looking around the cabin very few were eaten. i commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. come on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel? what planet are you on?,no
yes,"    i really enjoyed my flight from london to johannesburg. the aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite. in inflight entertainment had a wide selection. the food was ok but nothing to get excited about, i did eat all of it though. as i have grown older i have found long haul flights less tolerable so i was not really looking forward to this flight, however i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use british airways on that route again.",yes
yes,"     chicago to hyderabad via london heathrow. all flights left on time but the hyd-lhr one arrived an hour late. i literally had to run to find my way through heathrow to to board my connection. as for the ba flights, i found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. since i was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. my only issue with meals is, on the hyd-lhr leg, lunch was served very late. it was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. that kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. however, i wasn't impressed by the seats in ba flights. i found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because i also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which i could in the aa flight from lhr -> philadelphia). i also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. the aa flight from lhr -> philadelphia had bose noise canceling headphones, while the ba flights had just regular ones. no big deal, but still.",yes
yes,    san francisco to hyderabad via london. i had a really bad experience with british airways. i had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try british airways instead of taking my regular emirates. the flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. the customer care was unresponsive. i have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. i had to go book emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price. i wrote email to customer care. it has taken so much time to get a response from them. the bad part is they won’t refund your ticket price. i hope no one goes through such similar issue. my honest opinion: be sure of your travel plans before you book british airways. i was my first and last journey. i wont recommend personally to anyone.,no
yes,     london to duesseldorf on 21 january. flew with them 10 times over a one month period. this was the last of those flights. 8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelled. the flight i was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure. mayhem at the t5 customer service desk. far too few people to serve. seats on ba are terrible. everything costs extra. there is nothing good about ba anymore. ,no
yes,"    i had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life, my 50th birthday. on this occasion, i had invested in an upgrade and as such i expected nothing less. for 15 hours on an overnight flight i had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. i was downgraded as ba overbook their flight by 10%. their offer of compensation was £200! i am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. this experience has caused undue stress and at this point i am reluctant to use their services in the future. their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values: “meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming british airways into the world's leading global premium airline. our investment in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.” the experience with ba has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday! i feel i have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience!",no
yes,"    flew london to bengaluru. british airways have reached a new low. flight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working to replace a pin. two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne. cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful. the ba premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. the promised fine china dining experience only relates to main course. all other food and drink was served in plastic. the entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. the chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. entertainment screen was marbled and very small. reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible. breakfast service made no pretence to premium service. served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery. a very unpleasant experience. i have no wish to repeat, but sadly i have to return to heathrow in the same way.",no
yes,"    we flew british airways 194 and ba 197 into/out of heathrow late jan 2018, seats 27f/h and 30f/h respectively. seats were comfortable but the electronic boxes took up some of the legroom. food was ok, this is coach, so no really high expectations. plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly. the ife worked flawlessly, good selection of programs. bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight. we had beverage runs about every 1.5 hrs, if you wanted anything else, snacks were available in galley. ba did a good job.",yes
yes,"     reykjavik to london. i had to pay £8 to change seats at check-in, £80 for one checked-in baggage. you also have to pay for food and beverages on board the aircraft. all those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies, but now that we know those are traits shared with ba, we will also avoid ba in the future.",no
yes,"     bangkok to lisbon via heathrow. we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july 2017 for the travelling date of december 24, 2017. one day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (bkk > lhr) without prior notice through any communication channels (email, sms text) by ba. after many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand. however, we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk. she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the bkk > lhr flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis. the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online 24 hours before the flight. if we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but ba's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. finally, we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve. i find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiences. we chose british airways in hopes of a seamless and stress-free travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help.",no
yes,     johannesburg to cape town. a really basic flight operated by comair. no inflight entertainment. you had a usb plug to charge your phone. they served breakfast - it was early in the morning. overall a flight with no problems. the ground and air staff was good.,yes
yes,"     london heathrow to paris orly. flight arrived 40 mins late, nearly double the scheduled flight time. as all short haul british airways flights no complimentary food or beverages, or included checked baggage. premium airline price, budget airline service. i only use as ba have a virtual monopoly on heathrow and to maintain oneworld status.",no
yes,"    flew on ba 1414 from london heathrow to belfast city airport, january 16th. check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process. breakfast offered on board was good and tasty. we arrived in belfast 5 minutes ahead of schedule and luggage was out within 10 minutes. overall good flight and service.",yes
yes,"     i was supposed to fly from new york to paris with a direct flight. but they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to london - the new york to london flight got 3 hours delay, therefore we missed our connection in london. we waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight from london to paris, this flight got also cancelled, we rebooked a flight and waited another 2 hours. this flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time. we finally left the airport and took the eurostar otherwise we could not get home - they lost our luggage we received them a week later to our home! after 30 hours we got home and complained to british airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight, eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but they never answered.",no
yes,"    flew singapore to madrid via london heathrow with british airways. seat had a broken table and nowhere to move to unless downgraded. service was inattentive at best. suitcase did not arrive and after repeated attempts to speak to customer service to express the urgency of receiving suitcase for which i had received automated message stating it was at local airport i was told ‘ba does not have the telephone number for office at mad so all that could be done is wait for case to arrive.’ this is beyond ridiculous. company used to deliver bag, eventually, was horrendous. they asked to meet them at corner as they could not park when parking was clearly available. too many options in business to put up with this ‘low cost’ service at premium fares.",no
yes,"     gatwick to tobago. many years since i've flown in ba club class. interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. outbound flight to tobago on 1 january was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn't turned up. floor around seat not vacuumed properly. looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. fa took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. invited over pa system to read high life magazine - not in seat pocket - had to ask. pre-flight drinks served ok. when asked for meal choice, options didn't correspond with what was on menu. asked fa if i had wrong menu. fa insisted it was right menu. looked again and fa said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. seat was comfortable, if snug. ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for fas to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat. meal tray not horizontal. didn't bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. flight had caught up a bit on arrival at antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. arrived tobago 5 hrs late. return overnight flight left tobago on time. old school fas on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusive. don't think ba trains them like that any more. meal tray came with dessert already on it i hadn't selected. when converted to bed, seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can't bend your legs, as i do, in sleep. got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. seems fairly common for fas on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking, if you're obviously awake, if they can get you anything. not on this flight. i guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring ""club kitchen"". breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early. i can remember when a flight on ba club class was something to look forward to. cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service. not so any more, based on these 2 flights.",no
yes,    no curtains in business class: once again british airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they don’t matter. this flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class: passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet. why pay more to fly business then? dreadful! flew in from chicago to heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest i’ve ever seen and with awful food. the controls in my first class seat did not work either. british airways is fast going down the drains. avoid!,no
yes,"    flew british airways from warsaw to london heathrow. my complaint is about the cabin luggage policy. my full-size cabin bag was given a 'yellow tag' and i had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full. if you don’t have enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin bags, please introduce the wizz air solution (the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price) or decrease the allowed luggage size. the current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair.",no
yes,"     i was due to fly london heathrow to vancouver jan 7th.  six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled. when i called in (after waiting for 45 minutes on hold), i was told it was due to 'operational requirements'. a lot of back and forth, but the bottom line, ba could not get me back to yvr until thursday. i could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. or they could fly me into seattle on tuesday and i must make my way home from there on my own dime, and i could submit for reimbursement from ba - no guarantees they will reimburse though. i was told when ba cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home. i am flying air canada when i return to the uk in february. at least if they cancel my flight, they will make a better effort to get me back home.",no
yes,"     london heathrow to madrid connecting onto iberia to panama city. had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for business class flights ba still wanted £20 per person each way to pre book our seats. we tried to check in on line and were unable to. when we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to costa rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in madrid airport. this flight had been booked since march 2017 and no one had raised this the assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage. we were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to madrid the seats were the same as economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat. we were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard we were, we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in club world. we were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that's just greedy.",no
yes,"     london to dusseldorf. my suitcase didn't arrive. i was unable to file a claim upon arrival because ba 940 was delayed and i had to catch a train to osnabrück but was told i could file online. that is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept american airlines strap tag numbers. i tried to call the number i was given but the agents in madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after i explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the dus baggage office. i called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to madrid who again refused to take the claim. finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents i found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. however, i did not still see my suitcase until four days later. now i am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor's consultation, and replacement medication). on another topic, £1.80 for a tin of coca cola?",no
yes,"     johannesburg to london. awful, pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant. my seat area was absolutely filthy. when i asked the stewardess to assist, she looked at me like i was such a nuisance, made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper.  between 3-4am in the morning, i went in search of snacks. found the cabin staff in the kitchen area. when i asked, please may i have some snacks, i was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. not one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), they kept serving the person next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn't matter that they blocked my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuse me, please can we, nothing. rudeness at it's best. if you asked anything, the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore, and made one feel like you were being a burden.",no
yes,"     london to bangkok. i was a bit apprehensive about flying ba club world due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. boarding at heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. on board i offered a pre champagne or water. once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. meal pre ordered online. i found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. the staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. i know ba club seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any middle east airline i have flown with. entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at ba. i also must commend ba for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. there rapid response and actions probably saved his life, i flew on 12 january. well done ba, you are pulling in the right direction again.",yes
yes,"    what i have to say. “to fly, to serve”, a very well respected motto. british airways is always a good choice. i was flying business class from lgw to fco, everything was excellent! the crew were really nice for the whole flight, i was travelling solo and i had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food. we got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice (i got champagne and salmon!) everything was lly tasty. we departed and landed on time (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and i really appreciate this every time.) so, what to say, british airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best european airlines. their success is surely deserved.",yes
yes,"    san jose, ca to london heathrow round-trip in club world. had originally booked in premium economy but received upgrade offers from british airways that were too go to pass up. extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. cabin crew came by constantly to see how i was doing on both legs. lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. the seat itself was not as wide as i anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. the 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. comfortable and quiet. fast track passes an added plus. flying out of san jose is a bonus since i'm a ten minute drive to home. overall very pleased with british airways and the service provided. access to lounges at both airports another plus ! no complaints from me. will look to fly ba again later this year. just hope they have more offers for business class.",yes
yes,     dubai to london. cabin looked dire and wasn't particularly clean. seats are dreadful. sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle. product must be about 15 years out of date. food was of poor quality. no mid-flight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches.  second meal was tiny. arrived at a bus gate in london. no bus appeared for about 30 minutes. crew blamed the bus providing company. overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat. ,no
yes,"     london to düsseldorf return. outbound flight from londiin city was fine. boarding was quick and smooth, flight was not too busy. nice crew, on time departure and a breakfast tray, which i did not expect. on the flight back a319 to heathrow and you need to buy on board. don't understand the concept of ba. it's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. they should decide, if they are a full-service airline or low cost. i understand that they are under pressure, but they are usually more expensive than lufthansa  and a completely different story, if compared to easyjet. easyjet is not offering any great service, but you wouldn't expect it. with ba prices are like full-service, but value for money is much worse than easyjet or eurowings.",no
yes,"     new york to london. my flight was cancelled on november 17th. the day i was supposed to fly in the evening, i received text when i was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that i had to leave in middle. after talking to one of the agents for hour and a half, i was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from charlotte instead of new york. in order to get this new flight i had to be at jfk airport at 1:45 pm. to make this happen, i had to skip all last minute arrangements. the flight from charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to london. our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours. on top of longer and uncomfortable commuting, i was unable to sit with my children. the meal i requested was not available on the new flight. absolute worst experience! while flying back from london to new york on november 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn’t have our requested meal available! it was my first experience with british airways and i’ll make sure it’s the last one. on my flight back to new york i requested water to one of the attendants and she didn’t turn back for 9 minutes! i reminded her. she said she has been very busy. no apology, no courtesy, nothing. a big name like british airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff.",no
yes,"    flew british airways from bangkok to aberdeen via heathrow. no complaints. flight a little delayed on the return leg but all-in-all was good. ba and the rest of the european airlines cant quite keep up with the middle eastern airlines in terms of aircraft (emirates, etihad etc always seem to have the latest models) but the service, food, check-in, luggage allowance etc was all good. too many people put ba down but thats just the british way - we should get behind out national carrier.",yes
yes,"    flew british airways from rotterdam to london city. our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point ba needs to improve. also check in via ba-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at rotterdam and london city. price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and i booked well in advance. paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine. the advantage of london city is, apart from the distance to london, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride.",yes
yes,"    flew british airways from london to cape town. where to start! yesterday 6th january our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. after a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the hilton hotel next door. so we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the ba desk to collect our vouchers. we duly went along to the hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. the desk staff told us they were trying to phone ba to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. so at this stage my husband and i decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to london safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th january. we duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. oh dear ba, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? just too efficient for you i guess. so we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem ba we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it. you used to be such a wonderful airline, flying our country's colours proudly and we were proud of you, it's almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers.",no
yes,"    the first class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish. the seats were very comfortable and completely functional. entertainment choices were current, varied, and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety. the cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. the food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience. the breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered. overall, an extremely pleasant experience. there is no wi-fi available on this aircraft type.",yes
yes,"     toronto to london return – business to london and first back to toronto all on avios. fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team. fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. ba (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – premium plaza. its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking ba?) fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. late with champagne, wash bag after take off etc. with only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. we were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. all choices were available but the food is just not club standard. poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for?? got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in, fast track and concorde lounge. excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences. the crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. however, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.",no
yes,"     las vegas to manchester via london. fairly dire as always. ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak, before even having rolled it out. addicted to cuts. perfect partner for aa. so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did i not fly a low cost airline? there no difference whatsoever? the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. and what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to vegas? a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. no oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul i assume, nobody ate it. the main was tomato pasta or curry. the curry was so appalling i ate none of it. the chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. no cheese, crackers these days, nothing. served with cold tea. i really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from t3 to lhr t5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. and to top it all of, ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express. i have another flight in may which is non-refundable, i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. this is not a full service airline. it is fully no frills. the only exception is, i think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. the airline is a national embarrassment. the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more. i'm going to try lufthansa, or thomas cook, though i admit i'm dreading that prospect.",no
yes,"     london to dubai.  this was a terrible flight with grubby cabins, same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying. the staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language. if ba actually knew their premium passengers they would have avoided this.",no
yes,"     amsterdam to london. service ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. every two years or so i fly with ba, and every two years i am reminded just why i don't normally fly with them. whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. ba? didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyjet, ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, ba doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. so not only was the flight delayed, but i now had to wait for a suitcase. once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly, i managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time i'd flown with them). additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. do not fly ba, save your money and go with a budget airline. the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.",no
yes,"     london to johannesburg. i was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from lhr-jnb, i booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than emirates and qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. the a380 seats were reasonably comfortable and i had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard wifi is a big letdown too. food was standard airline food, neither good or bad but ok. ba has been taken over for air travel by the big middle eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haul only.",yes
yes,     will never fly with ba again. outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos. our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. i agree. flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. no assistance provided by ba. told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out. took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. was told i couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. looked at ba site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. called back but they refused to put me in the cabin i had paid for saying i had volunteered to downgrade and i would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for. ba is now as bad as ryanair so will never fly with them again. they're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.,no
yes,"     london to tel aviv.  i have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of british airways. i landed in tel aviv and waited one hour for my bag to appear and when it didn’t, i went to the qas counter and gave them my information. for three days, my bag was in london before reaching tel aviv, and then the driver didn’t bring my bag to where i was staying.",no
yes,"    i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british airways. having flown premium economy before, i had certain expectations of what i would be getting, but i was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. the plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. from premium economy, i expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where i was constantly pushing against it. i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. the personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. the headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where i kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that i could actually hear anything. expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. i find it shocking that ba charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. i needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, i phoned ba and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time. i booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more, i got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.",no
yes,"     hong kong to london before christmas in first class. boarding was a little chaotic. there was no priority for first class passengers. maybe the flight was fully booked. cabin crew was very attentive and efficient. service was excellent. ba does not have the best first class product, but their staff is the best in europe. food was tasteful and wine selection was superb. i had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at lhr. looking forward to flying with them again in january.",yes
yes,"     dublin to heathrow. ba gets worse and worse and worse. today was special though. as usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn’t - after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn’t started. again, as usual, club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. today as a special treat they hadn’t heated the paninis for my row - so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients. and finally they ran out of champagne- about the only advantage left of club. ",no
yes,"     london to new york. aircraft was very dated, ife poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we’re outdated a decade ago. the meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. to top everything off the crew couldn’t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! when you tell ba about a negative experience they’ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don’t waste your money flying ba - i’ve had far more positive experiences on ryanair.",no
yes,"     new york to london. ife was good and the meal wasn’t bad. drinks were served throughout the flight. before we landed crisps and a chocolate were handed out. on the return trip when we arrived at jfk the queues were terrible. after we got through the queues, the gate staff announced the plane would be delayed by one hour due to a  technical fault. return flight was enjoyable but the plane was very outdated and ife screens were tiny. ",yes
yes,     budapest to philadelphia via london. they changed my return flight by more than 4 hours. when i asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there. called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy. then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes. wonder what they do with the miles. the worst business class i have flown. never buy their premium class. lounge in london is worse than the free lounge an american express card provides. what the heck is wrong with them?,no
yes,"    london heathrow to hong kong on the a380 a couple of weeks ago. i flew in premium economy, which was obtained through points. the seats were comfy and felt quite spacious, however i am quite a small person. glasses of champagne/wine offered on arrival, and the food was quite good. the attendants were polite. inflight entertainment was decent, i especially liked the ""festive season"" section, which had a variety of holiday/christmas movies. plane left and arrived on time. having had several negative experiences with british airways in the past, i was pleasantly surprised with this flight.",yes
yes,"     london to montreal. very bad service with delayed luggage. for some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. i was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to dublin. first guy i talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? in theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal. but after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, i decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in dublin. a second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. a couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, i decided to call them back again. this time my suitcase wasn't in dublin, it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. this guy, asked me to call them back, monday morning london time, so i did. i called back again on monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when i had done that same day i placed the delayed luggage report. don't they have all this info in file?. after telling him that i did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. i'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. no compensation was mentioned to me, even that i had to buy clothes and some other items that i already had in my suitcase. lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. i understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. i think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, i would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me. after this awful experience with their missing luggage department, i hardly doubt i will use british airways again.",no
yes,"     london to houston. executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day. the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 usd to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes, furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. needless to say that because we are away for christmas & new year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. because we have been given 801 usd no phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items. ",no
yes,"     las vegas to london. absolutely horrendous experience! we were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours (in high temperatures with no air conditioning - the passengers were all sweating) before the plane took off. kept saying it would be 10 mins and then 15 mins. 2 hours odd later we finally took off. economy on ba is horrible. seats are uncomfortable, no space, can hardly get refreshments (the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water), food is bad. to make it worse, when we landed in london we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because ba didn't have a spare arrivals gate. due to all the delays, we had to run like mad people to get from heathrow to gatwick in time for our onward flight with ba. against all odds, we got their with 30 mins to spare (plane hadn't boarded yet) but they casually said we were too late and said we'd have to fly the next day. absolute joke, i won't be flying with ba again when i have a choice.",no
yes,"    flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow. overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through t5. unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. b747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. the food was ok. the biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. no smiles or even a ""welcome on board"" whilst walking down the aisle. on arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. the service provided by ba has significantly declined over the past few years. even the newer planes (b777 and b787) haven't got cabins that compete with todays market. also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat. very very disappointed that i didn't choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price.",no
yes,"    i was on a flight from new york jfk - budapest via london heathrow on 9th december the flight was delayed 6hrs, when i arrived to london i got information that my flight to budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow. that was on the 10th december. i was there with a few thousends other passengers from ba, nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. after waiting 2-3 hrs for my suitcase i was struggling with cold at terminal 4. someon from ba took us to terminal 5. today is 12th december and i am still in london without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to budapest. i paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels ba offered are fully booked. this is not what you normally expect from british national carrier airlines. very poor website, nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre, they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense.",no
yes,"    flew tokyo narita to london heathrow with british airways. flight delayed by four hours - which is understandable due to the weather in the uk at the time. the inflight entertainment was awful. it was good for only a short haul journey. very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens. plus they kept stalling. the staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. we were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. the food was average and i was very hungry throughout the service. as far as i am aware, on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible - i don’t call being starved very comfortable! other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey. why can’t you? you used to be the best and now you’re budget. i won’t be flying with british airways again. ",no
yes,"    i was quite disappointed with my experience with british airways. first of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in lhr. however, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. however, there was no information on connecting flights in lhr. once on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying ryanair or british airways. seats were okay but nothing outstanding - same with the crew.",no
yes,"    flew british airways to pisa due to flight times and ba miles. overall a poor economy class product. the seats were really tight. staff were ok, but seemed stressed. you had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of ba and they predict other airlines will follow suit. difficult to get a glass of water. three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. at check-in their automated system failed so it was done manually - thank goodness for carbon units still employed by ba. overall ba is dramatically failing. those who have ba miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. ba is no longer uk's national airline. the magic of alex cruz and willie walsh is not working if it ever did. avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets. loyalty does not pay.",no
yes,     london to toulouse. british airways is no longer a full service airline. to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with m&s food. this is over-priced and not that great. secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. this was the case in this flight to toulouse. next time go to pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. i asked for a glass of water. this came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. at least offer people water - it is a human right. the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for ba's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. i hope that this is not true. the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. customer care and service has gone. avoid ba if you can. consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers. they are better and more responsive.,no

yes,"     london to rome. it's been a while since i last flew on ba and it certainly has changed. while the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. it seems that ba is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as european destinations are concerned. presumably, this is due to the competition from easyjet and ryanair as well as it's ceo hailing from vueling. i suppose it's only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and ba flies out of lhr.",yes
yes,"     london to manchester. hard to complain about a flight which last 35 mins but i was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection. this flight used to include complimentary tea/bacon sandwich until the much criticized move to m&s inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isn't available anymore. all things considered, that is understandable.",yes
yes,"     london to seattle, a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about. efficient and professional service, meal service fine, good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra. ife selection was perhaps a little limited. bags slow to arrive at seattle but don't put that on ba.",yes
yes,"     seattle to london. good experience all round and nothing much to complain about. fa's efficient and friendly, flight was on time. meal quality was average. overall, believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although i had cashed in some miles to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy. major complaint is ba's policy of charging to book a seat - it's extremely irritating and stressful, especially in premium economy upwards.",yes
yes,"     london to barcelona. the ground service was really poor even thought i used premium counter (sapphire status of ow).  i paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak english. staff could not distinguish the taiwan passport from the china passport and keep said that we need visa to go to spain. it took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad. the worst staff i had  met. although ba sold a very expensive ticket, however, even a cup of water you have to pay for it. i would never choose this airline again.",no
yes,"     vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had. i was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. we actually had to beg for help. the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare. the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. the 2 seniors had to walk all that way. it was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. they said that they called the buggy and that was all. we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in london) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service. summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out. seats were another problem. we did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12d for one senior (isle) and 18d (isle) for the other senior. when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. so once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver. surprise surprise! we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage.  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs. there was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. so nightmare again!! and another rush to us to get to the next fligh. according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. what can you expect from british airways? if it doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver.",no
yes,"    london to berlin tegel return. it's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british airways and the budget airlines. the only saving grace is that i've never experienced any issues flying out of or into t5. noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful. my flight to berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn't offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats. i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly.

yes,"    flew london heathrow to dubai. arrived at the new ""wing"" at t5. a quick process and into the concorde lounge. i noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the concorde lounge per se. ""just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge."" this option was rammed. am pleased to confirm that the concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. it looks a bit better. had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal b. friendly fa showed me and wife to our seats. looked freshly cleaned. pushed back on time. 1st class was full. airborne i had dinner: mezze to start which was nice. some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. cheese and biscuits to conclude. wines were ok. the seat (the new ""first"") - is not wearing well. looking somewhat tired. managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. i am a tall guy and need the space. the club world option is horrendous. very pleased to confirm that mr alex cruz (bas ceo) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st wc. readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. if mr cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. so a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. the flowers (for 2 wcs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. the 1st product is very mediocre compared with say emirates. some have said its ""sort of an upmarket business class"". i'd agree with that. one would think, ba would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food.

yes,"    berlin to london city. i have never experienced such an unreliable, unprofessional airline, that is so hard to contact. my flight kept being delayed for hours. after more than 4 hours delay, there was no point for me to fly to london anymore, as i had missed an important meeting. i was told that i will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation. after a few days i call their customer support to ask about the refund. they told me that i will get the refund within 7 days. after 4 weeks, i notice that they still haven't refunded me. it's very difficult to contact them. the phone hotline is only available until 5pm (monday-friday). they hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website. once i managed to send them a message, i only get a reply a few days later telling me, that they can't reply to this case via email and that i should call. all i want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund. i take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times. after being on hold for a while, it turns out, they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours. a very convenient mistake, to forget a 360€ refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry. only after i asked what compensation i will get for this, i was offered 5000 avios points. no thanks, with that level of unreliability and bad customer service, i will make sure to never fly british airways again. i make sure to tell all my friends about this experience.",no

yes,"    flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british airways. one issue after another! the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in london, we departed late. we should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via washington! our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from amsterdam to catch the flight. the delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further. we eventually arrived in washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight - there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. united (acting on behalf of ba) checked us onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. ironically, the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco as business class was full. we eventually got to san francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in class. they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre-booked (but unused) hotel in san francisco. the airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility. not a good experience at all and nobody really cares!",no
yes,"    manchester to london. we were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding, but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue! then on the flight it was the case of 2 ends of the plane on either side of the curtain, those in the front were offered a quick sandwich and a drink those behind had to purchase. the short flight was on time, the leg room in front of the plane was exactly same as at the rear except the middle seat was blocked off! though it felt like business class in the plane, on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not! ba needs to improve and fast?",no
yes,"     london to athens. on the date of the flight i received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so i could check in my carry on luggage for free, later on another text saying that i will have 46 minute delay. i was at the airport almost 3 plus hours before. checked in at the machines but it couldn't allocate my seat number. then a british airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number. seating at a cafe i was checking the tv screen every 5-10 minutes and it said delay 12:46. my flight was scheduled for 12:00. at 11:45 i tried to pass through security but the machine would allow me to scan my boarding pass and asked me to seek assistance. the security officer told me that i lost the flight because my flight was at 12:00 and suggested me to go to counter c1. now at the counter c1 a lady told me that the flight was at 12:00 and i lost it. while i was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made phone calls and tried to explain the whole situation. then she told me to go through security because the bar code on my boarding pass will be valid for 2 minutes! went straight to my exit and it was packed from people sitting. waited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to athens was 1hr 20mins.",no
yes,"    very disappointing. i was scheduled on a british airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at heathrow and having flown ba in the past it was very sad to see how ba service went down this year. meal and drinks for purchase, uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight. i would fly a low cost carrier instead, since that's exactly what ba now achieves. many years ago it was one of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly ba, now it's just another shrinking violet.",no
yes,"    this was really a no frills business class. this flight was part of trip with qatar airways. unfortunately, the london to doha was operated by british airways. the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines. the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options. the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay. the fas were really dull, nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines. ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin. it might be excellent innovation back in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on.",no
yes,"    british airways is seriously lacking in all areas. singapore to sydney return in economy. fly the route often, usually with qantas which are great. the flight out to sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to maximise their sleep. especially those who have come from london. cabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. after departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest. during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. the food is very average also. two hours before landing, they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic. no tea or coffee. the competition is too strong for this route. i would never use them again.",no
yes,"     london heathrow to basel. boarding: there are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) since i was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, i found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. yes, ba appears intent on replicating england's class system!  on board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a french atc strike. obviously, this was not ba's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. after take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. why ba offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their bob service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. the no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. the trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. end of service. someone at the back quipped, 'so you opted for the premium seats, too!' yes, ba is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. it wasn't until i had left the airport that i was able to get that cup of tea. needless to say, eurowings and easyjet do things much better.",no
yes,"     miami to london heathrow. a bit of a mixed bag. boarding at miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! so much for safety. seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at heathrow. also my wife’s ife failed mid flight. impossible to hear information from the flight deck. these ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. the congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. the minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired. the only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew. they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support. flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly.",no
yes,"     prague to washington via london. british airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown. unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg, if i want to connect on their one world partner aa, which i have exec plat status with. ba charges for everything, including water. prg-lhr is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that i should have thought of it earlier. london to washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. entertainment system has about 40 movies, compared to about 200 options on aa flights. overall horrible experience. the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. ba, what is it about your flights prg-lhr, with your onboard luggage allowance only? they charge usd 100 for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners?  horrible food, aircraft, lhr and transfer experience. good luck ba, will avoid at all costs. included a picture from the bathroom which was broken.",no
yes,"     cape town to london. i can report a positive experience on our flight. from the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. seats 4e/f suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. the menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. the ife screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. still no wifi, of course. take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism. an excellent flight, overall.",yes
yes,"     bangkok to london heathrow. despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe, on this route ba has a daylight flight (i can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. the fare was also pretty good. in the end, i have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. my issues were the following. i purchased a ticket in premium economy. the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the lhr-bkk-lhr route have been refitted. the seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. come on ! yes i got my amenities kit, a better pillow british papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. but the seat is old, not that comfy, the ife belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat. the seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great. the meal service was not good out of bkk. bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. no cheese nor crackers. not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the j/c had a brand new a la carte service as well.  cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. the only false note was the meal pre-selection. you get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. you have to wait for a very long time. by then my meal was cold and i sent it back. they did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. other than that it was this time a decent meal. having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. not acceptable on such a long haul. funny enough the bkk-lhr feature three meals so why not on the lhr-bkk leg ?. ba could be so much better. they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .",no
yes,"    after 3 hour delay at airport, flight destined for verona with arrival time of 21.35, was rerouted to venice, meaning bus transfer and arrival at 2.30am. we passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. i had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. at such an unsociable hour of the morning, i could no longer disturb her. i explained all this to ba, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and i would be reimbursed. on arrival, i was brusquely told by a ba rep to go online and find my own accommodation. after a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. i was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where i should have been. it transpires ba knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. i wasted 5 hours at gatwick (when i could have carried on working). also had i known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. to top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. ba had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. further wait. not only had i missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment british airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination. i hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills i incurred (£45) - but i did expect ba to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture. not impressed.",no

yes,"     tel aviv to london. we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. the stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. there were limited priority options available for first class passengers, although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airways. the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. if it was just business then it would be ‘fine i guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in hebrew. at the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. the service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask. they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. the food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. it would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which i have had before on ba and with other airlines, even in business class. on arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in israel. i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.",yes
yes,"     london to tel aviv. arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. this wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. in terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets. whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! even the thales system is showing its age now, but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money. having said that, i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash.",yes
yes,"     kuala lumpur to madrid via london. my first time flying ba and i had very low expectations. fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. the service (kul-lhr) was brusque. meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. i had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt no and that they couldn't give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. so if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal. luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. what i didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. the armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle. the seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside. the toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn't work properly. they always fall back down and there was never seat liners. food was below average.",yes
no,❎    madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair. boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. this resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. every single seat was occupied. this was quite hard on the staff. a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk based tv personalities. this was in english only. the inflight service was very poor. i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. i regard this as a health and safety matter. british airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.,no
no,❎    flew british airways from bologna to london heathrow. we arrived at bologna airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. we were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. the member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. for us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the lake district the following day. we were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation. i thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines!,no
no,"❎    my husband and i booked our honeymoon to italy through american airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines, british airways. we ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at london heathrow and we would not arrive in rome in the am as planned. we decided to give it a shot regardless. we arrived at bwi and discovered we were not on an aa flight and had packed more bags than ba would allow. (we had three checked bags instead of 2 and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. i can't say the same for the rest of our trip. we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. we arrived into london around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome. the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner. upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account. we eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london. once we arrived at rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. otherwise i imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london. if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey.

no,"  verified review    london heathrow to seoul incheon. i was flying my return leg back to korea after a christmas vacation. i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. to start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. i couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of 50% of the available selections. quite disgraceful. i was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. the rest of the airport process after that was smooth. this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if i wanted to get out of my chair in flight. of course i had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. the flight was uneventful. on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated. overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.",no

no,"  verified review    london to santiago. cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. the food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle. i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat. another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. and that adds to the litter problem. after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? er, drop it on the floor? i did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked. another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. and i don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no a-z. all in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",yes

no,"  verified review    gatwick to orlando return. worst ever long-haul business class flight.  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). we have never liked ba’s business class (club world) seats since they changed over to the yin-yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. the seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul business class flight we have experienced. to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) in order to get out of the centre seats (rows e and f) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. the return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap. the service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. the entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age. this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. it will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. we will probably never fly ba long-haul business class (club world) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",no

no,"  verified review    i flew from london heathrow to sofia and back. the plane on both flights was an airbus 321 and i’d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior. i am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – i certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. both flights departed the gate on schedule (although actual take-off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over europe). the cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. on both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress. so far, top marks to british airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service. it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like lufthansa). the range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines i have flown with. but there the comparison ends because whilst i have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, ba’s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too. they also insist on card only transactions. i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the a321 is a long plane. a single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, i only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley, squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (the coffee, by the way, was excellent). the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved. in conclusion, clean plane, punctual service, pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service.",yes

no,"  verified review    on a flight from bangkok to london and you'll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices. first meal service has thai green curry (veg) and the second thai red curry (chicken). really? no one could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different? so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  i said, ""i don't want the prawns for starter as i'm having the prawn main meal."" i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  ok so prawns for starter and i'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. well i'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i wasn't eating them. the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. the bread roll didn't win any prizes either. i just gave up and refused to eat it. now when this was served i'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly. no problem, press the call bell. which is reset before anyone comes. press it again and think i'd better get on with eating my food. eventually some one arrives and notices i'm not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no one has answered my call button. obviously i'm just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and i'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. this does not appear for fifteen minutes. during that time i am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. so a couple of hours later i'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks. back at my seat i think i need a g&t with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. there is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin. i do find one in the second galley. i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times i've tried to use it and been ignored. bad service. now on to the second meal service. strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. i ask the fa about this but am just told everyone is having the same, no explanation. the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again. ok main meal, i'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembark. just not recommended at all.",no

no,"  verified review    san diego to london heathrow. the worst business class i have flown in! i flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, i still expected some level of comfort. the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. i'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. so your feet are raised. the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. the hydraulics must be connected. it was very annoying. the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. it was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat. there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. very awkward! the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle. the food. well. the fillet streak was tough and dry. i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job. the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. you are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! not ideal with some turbulence. there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such. apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. in short, ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. the layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the tv's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal. i for one will not be flying ba business again.",no

no,"  verified review    after flying boston to london on the a380-800, i returned on a recently retrofitted boeing 747-400. the 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights (they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the a380). the seatback tv and in-flight entertainment had been significantly upgraded. the only part of the cabin's aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights, which hadn't been replaced. the cabin crew was polite, professional, and accommodating – no complaints there. the captain even gave us a personal, genuine announcement before takeoff, which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long-haul flight. the flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours, 59 minutes, and without delay on either end. while i'm a bit concerned that ba is at risk of turning into a low-cost carrier under the current leadership, my experience was that his crew are still doing a great job.

no,"  verified review    naples to gatwick. i used to admire and love ba. i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe. my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately not with blessings. we had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does ba have to keep doing this? the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, food and magazines. when time came for boarding and, amongst others, club europe passengers were invited to board first, there was no check made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. once boarded, we were – unlike the other club europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). when i opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, something not everybody likes to do. this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exercise. on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu, rhodes, heraklion, even seville (contrary to ba’s website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access’) so, this time, my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples. she was told no; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we thought, but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening, we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for ba use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! why could the check-in staff not have told us? the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. however, when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards, passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood, were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side. club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called, so that did not look too bad. know what? we showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. in other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.",no

no,"  verified review    london to hong kong in premium economy. i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years, and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review. of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. one was from oslo to london on 9th june, when the captain decided to wait  for some business class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. my worst experience, however, was going to hong kong on 30th may, when there was a technical fault with the plane. the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. i was in premium economy, but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort. i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that i got no rest during the night. how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet? the in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy (but don't recline as they would in economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. predictably, the plane landed in hong kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th june, but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers. although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about ba, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. i will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba.",no

flew british airways from beijing to london heathrow. the cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of ba saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). the amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. to be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other one world members (royal jordanian and qatar for example). flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. the offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, i covered it up with a spare blanket. despite there being enough toilets for club world passengers there was often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. no control of passengers from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin. toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. lovely. shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels.",no

no,"  verified review    this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by ""mixed fleet"". easy check-in at toronto pearson (the ba ground staff are always great in toronto) with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to london. (used to be only ex london). fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. an ok chicken curry was served but i still don't see it as biz class food. a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. that is where the improvements ended. the morning offering of a cereal bar and t&cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience. the crew on this flight were great. young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! the return flight was less good. drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (crew member's first flight since qualifying) it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray. the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t&c. customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate. service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! the 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp, the ife screens are tiny. mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. however, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. what these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of long haul crew - i hope they relax into the role soon! at least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut i admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened. however, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us / canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world - it really depends on what ba do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - i'm off).",no

no,"  verified review    i took a long daytime flight from tokyo to london (about 12 hours). the boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the premium economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight, with good recline, although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space. the catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. a choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (i asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). by the time we landed i was hungry and thirsty, and i would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. the crew were invisible for most of the flight. the ife system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines. overall not recommended.",no

no,"  verified review    i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. to cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. for breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. the presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering. we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become. i fly regularly long haul with klm & their new business class offering is now far superior to ba's first. how can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior european & gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may. almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, ba have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5 & the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service, ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",no

no,"  verified review    choose a budget airline, the magic of our national carrier has gone. we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. easyjet provides this. secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. on boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. so the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40, but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""cabin crew, seats for landing"". the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. all minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with ba, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, i'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline. perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead. for me their usp was their service, without that there is no longer a point.",no

no,"  verified review    antigua to gatwick. check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. boarding was on time. on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's tv nearly falling off its mounting. fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. push back and departure was exactly on time. within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say 'i want you to go to sleep now and i don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why. in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands. we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us. overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba.",no

no,"  verified review   no, no, no, british airways. you've messed up. someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""let's provide food from m&s: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" the problem on my 18:55 flight from marrakech to london was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. a piece of friendly advice, ba, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. but what's this? only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. you're promising things you can't deliver, ba. there is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. the process i call 'ryanisation' of british airways is almost complete. you now charge for checked baggage (yes, i know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even ba used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? too costly, perhaps? i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""british airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",no
no,"  verified review   having only flown easyjet / ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, i was pleased to see a relatively low-cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome. in hindsight, i wish i'd booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation. to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. i expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food. i am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. no sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. i asked what they did have. their response 'bottle of water or a kit kat'. after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'they never give us enough food. it's mad. they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation. they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. i'd say i'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, i won't bother. what a shame.

no,"❎ unverified    london heathrow to munich return. it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba. sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore. the loss of the free bar/food service on european flights is a real step down. even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for m&s food on board. oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now i have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. not even a free tea or bottle of water? (i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). the 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance. not wishing to pay this, by the time i checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from. i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with easyjet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with ba). check-in at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. so i couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. there was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't ba's fault and didn't have a hige impact. flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. on the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. could we? no, the earlier flight was full. rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on lufthansa instead. in summary, if flying ba on european routes these days, be aware that ba is now a no-frills carrier. lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",no

no,"  verified review    flew london heathrow to gibraltar. this is probably the last time that i'll book a short haul with british airways from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. willie walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. ba are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. on our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. seems like a structural flaw in their offering. the other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating. so unless i'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows i think i'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

this latest british airways trip from london heathrow to dallas fort worth just confirms how standards are slipping. background: family living in usa = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying business for eastbound transatlantic leg. to date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with british airways. service has been almost consistently good or very good. we may not be gold or silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) original booking for outbound lhr-dfw leg was booked by ba agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. the executive club customer service link just sends you round in circles! a formal emailed complaint through ""contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight lhr-dfw departing 1030. refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. when asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. no problem. juice and water were available during the afternoon. no snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""cutbacks"". luckily i had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in usa). at 1830 cabin service (tea) started. when i asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""why didn't you order one?"" ""i did!"" ""she didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""yes, she did!"" ""oh well, i'll check when i've finished serving the main cabin"" really? we were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? clearly yes it would. and when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. no hint of an apology. customer service? customer satisfaction? result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? what do you think?",no

(i currently have 588,500 avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use). i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat. the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat - not the food. my comfort was not met. the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep.",no

no,"  verified review    i have been a loyal ba frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change. on my recent long haul flight to nairobi from london, i was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free - like some cut-rate budget short haul airline, you have to pay. however, unlike a budget airline, ba fares remain higher than most. i returned from nairobi in premium economy - yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare i paid to be in premium, breakfast consisted of 1 muffin - literally 1 muffin only - no juice, no fruit, no nothing. it is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have, as i have always done, accepted the higher fares for better service. even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime. it is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free. note that ba never cut fares when the price of oil halved, making the current cutbacks about pure avarice. disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula. and i wouldn't blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated. the final insult was the response i got when i tweeted my above complaints. i was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast - while paying the same fare. which as is apparent to all, a complete lie and insult to injury. i am flying again next week lon - nyc and hope, not optimistically, for better.

no,"amsterdam to london. as a member of their executive club and someone who has flown with british airways 3 times this year i now regard them as the airline of last resort. the service on ba is beneath contempt. ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying, but in my experience ryanair service and punctuality beats ba with their reliance on a long lost reputation. every ba flight i have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. from disruption in the cabin the like of which i have never witnessed on any airline other than british airways, to delays on nearly all ba flights i have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like ba was still a 1970's state enterprise. now when i search a flight and ba appears i shudder. it is even worth leaving the uk so you get a different national airline. there were even problems with the booking process. what makes matters worse is that british airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right.",no
no,"  verified review   london heathrow to san francisco with british airways. ba was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. they even hijack you for an additional $1000. or as i like to say, you cough up 200k in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers. a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. first class was maybe 50% full. when it was my turn, i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. at the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. way to go ba, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. third, when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first, ba is always hit and mostly miss. finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba. i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? yes, i say and not once has someone called. i am waiting for the day when ba announces ""all passengers including first"" should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale.",no

no,"  verified review    first leg dus to lhr was club europe. while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. crumbs on the seat. table was sticky. asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience: business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old. the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. in general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). lounge in lhr very outdated. boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. crew on board once again very friendly and effective. meal choice was ok. but my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. club kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays. selection seems to go down every time i fly. worst of all: one of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. after identifying that my bag seems to be lost i went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in boston). i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another bag -> although i had my tag that i could show to her. i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. no apologies for inconvience at all. last year i had one bag that was delayed. this handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. summarizing: flying ba for business for many years and on a regular basis now. the changes under the new boss can be seen. while in the past british airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. this time flight was one of the worst i ever had with ba. i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only one thinking like this. i can't any longer recommend ba as especially the value for money is no longer given.

no,"  verified review    london gatwick to antigua. having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of £350 to british airways world traveller plus, and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals and beverages. what we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasions in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received - it was more like a budget airline - we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off, this was quickly followed with a drink service (one drink per passenger), we then received our meal service. i asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice - about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin. after several hours when no other drinks service was offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé, to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine - which neither one of us drink. as the flight wasn't full i cant believe there would be a problem you just don't expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight? 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours - certainly not what i would expect from an airline such as ba. our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasn't full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. the service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. i was looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat - which i certainly don't think that justifies £350 upgrade fee. if you are thinking of upgrading i would think twice about what you are paying for. ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not alone in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic. ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route. if that is the case, they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.

no,"london to johannesburg return. still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. on flight ba 0055 to johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. we took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. this was the only drink offered that night. dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. we were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. we did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. it took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. when we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. prior to this flight we tried to avoid the “back of plane” issues by paying an additional £56.00 for exit row seats. the payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. when we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. when we arrived at johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. no apology or explanation was given. not the way we wanted our holiday to end. the service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. cabin staff were very good. we have not received a refund for the £56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and i await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. if the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. this is unfair and bad business practice. upon speaking to other people who have flown with ba, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. ba were not the cheapest flights by far, we opted to fly with them due to reputation, which was sorely let down.

no,"  verified review    lisbon to heathrow on british airways. i booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when i went to check-in online the ba website said i had been sold a seat-only flight. the travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. i called ba and was messed around by their staff member. i had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to london. at lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. the departure board did not show the check-in area for the ba flights. i had to find my own way to where ba check-in. i joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. when other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. the check-in lady i dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. the departure from lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. the cabin crew were very professional. the departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. my seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags. when things go well, ba is excellent. however, charges for baggage are outrageous and place ba in the same category as budget airlines. i give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin-crew though.",yes
no,"  verified review    gatwick to marrakech with my family for a 7 day holiday. first timer on british airways. pros: flight on time comfortable seats, generous luggage allowance. easy online check-in 24 hrs before. pleasant flight. con: meal - i thought they would provide proper hot meals i.e. rice and curry. however, route london to marrakech (and vice versa) only one type of cold meal, sandwich is served. also small chocolate dessert, biscuit and the usual tea, coffee or drink is provided. unfortunately i could not have the meal as i do not eat anything with added sugar. toilets - only saw 2 toilets which was rather over used and busy. entertainment/tv - none. i expected seats to be built-in with tvs so that kids could be busy and entertained. this was like a no frills airline. thankfully kids had their tablets with them. staff - okay, but could be bit more friendly and approachable. a smile would make the difference. return flight - airplane was bit dirty. i noticed crips bags tucked under the chair. overall a 3 star airline in my opinion.

i have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. over the years british airways first has gone so far downhill i'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as i see them are all resolvable. however, the return leg was like flying with ryanair. there were only 13 people in the cabin. there were no slippers, 2 of the menu items i requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. my father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which i then missed assuming i would be woken. there was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. finally, we collect our suitcases, which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. ba have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. when comparing the service / food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound, ba just doesn't cut the mustard any longer i'm afraid. such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?

no,"  verified review    london heathrow - vancouver - london heathrow. first impressions could have been better as this flight departs from terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at heathrow. the departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. however the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. once on board i found the cabin to be very clean. unlike many airlines, ba offers economy seating upstairs on the a380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. however the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. the ife system provided is excellent. i also ordered one of ba's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. this option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. the service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where british airways seems to do consistently well. if i have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. arrival at vancouver was on time and i was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. processing through security for departure from yvr was equally efficient. the return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in london was an hour late. however the relatively quiet cabin on the a380 meant that i was able to get some sleep. unfortunately the arrival experience at lhr terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. a lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration. a marked contrast to the experience at yvr.",yes

no,"  verified review    los angeles to rome via london with british airways. our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good. we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for $382 each. we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco (costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco). boarding was not well organized. our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad. we had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. when we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. we waited another 25 minutes for buses. seats were fairly comfortable. food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. we arrived in rome almost 2 hours late. coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome. boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff. everyone seemed confused. snack on board was small but tasty. we had to be ""express serviced"" through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight. no time to catch a snack or use the toilet. boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. you had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. food was pretty good. on board entertainment was good. service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london. we arrived 25 minutes late to lax. i also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.

no,"  verified review    london heathrow to newark return. having just returned from my holiday, flying with british airways in their world traveller plus class, i thought i would post my review. the week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so i had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. we flew out of t5 at lhr one what i think is one of ba’s new 787 to newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. we took our seats 21 j and k which were right next to the toilets. on our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. i had plenty of leg room (ok, i am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. once the curtain was pulled between us and world traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. we were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. hot towels were handed out. menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. the food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. the food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. however, during food service another drink was also offered. so, three small bottles of wine for the flight and i was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. as we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. as there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. the seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, i felt i had plenty of room. although i had loaded up my tablet with films and books, i didn’t use it at all. neither did i use the vast choice of ife – i used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. my partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. after food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. a sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). the pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. i quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. however, the toilets were clean. the landing was smooth and we arrived on time – i suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? on leaving the plane i did have a look at business class, and without offending regular business class users, i did wonder exactly what you get for your money. all the pods looked very tightly packed together.",yes

no,"  verified review    we travelled on ba 633 from athens on 12th of june, 2016. the flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at london. nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. what went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. we had showed up early but was refused check in at club europe. the ground attendant at athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. if they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. when we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at club europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. the middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. british airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. we were placed on the last row of business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. it was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. to be fair, i think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. furthermore, when asked for a blanket, i was refused one on the basis there was none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. how is this fair? what principle of seat assignment did they use? the last few ba trips to europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). we were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our exec club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell ba that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). in fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). i cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.",no

no,"  verified review    i think that british airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievement. having booked our flight from alicante to gatwick i immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. when i came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, i found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. when i selected 'change your seat' row 4 was not even displayed. i am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. for this reason i am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines i did not and have not received any notification from ba to tell me they had changed the seating. nor have i received my money back. while waiting to board the plane i received a text message survey on my ba experience so far. i participated and gave a summary of the situation. i also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. when i got home i gave ba one day to contact me but when they did not i submitted a complaint through their website. after some days i got a reply saying: 'would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? we’ll be more than happy to see if you’re eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. i cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. but with ba you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. my family take many flights each year including long hauls to asia. needless to say that none of these will ever be on british airways.",no

no,"  verified review    at the beginning of the year i booked 4 first class seats london-kansas usa for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. at that time i also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. at check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. after some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. at security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. when i complained the supervisor told me i would not be boarding the flight if i didn't keep quiet. once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and i requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. it arrived but i was told i could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. the flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. the staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. on talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. i had spent thousands on the flights, i had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. in the usa the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and i was allowed to accompany her all the way. to add insult to injury on the flight back half the tv sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. my mum refuses to fly ba again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to virgin and other carriers. i have complained to ba but as of yet no response.

no,"las vegas to london heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with british airways. both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything i've ever experienced flying on any other airline. i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but i was uncomfortably hot the whole time. my husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. the staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. on our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. i thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! a group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. they had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. they were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. a couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. this poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. the boarding process in las vegas was smooth, but boarding at heathrow was a joke. the staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. as a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. it made boarding take forever. the entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. a few decent movies but not much else. i thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.",no

no,"  verified review    we arrived at gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to st lucia. check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. after tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. the on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. at this point i did venture down to the british airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, i gave up and sat down again. at 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. during all of this time i should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. despite numerous announcements from easyjet and other airlines ba was conspicuous by its silence. we were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. eventually we boarded just after 14.30. when everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. we eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. now i know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of ba's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from gatwick being dumbed down by ba in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of heathrow. i have no idea whether this is true or not but i would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from heathrow to jfk, would ba have found a solution quicker? once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.",no

going against the grain somewhat i have to say that i truly prefer flying with british airways over emirates on the london heathrow - dubai route. having tried both airlines several times i am definitely going to side with ba on this one. firstly, ba offer some really competitive prices on this route. if you happen to have a few avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. secondly, out of lhr, ba really does have the best terminal. okay, so terminal 3 for emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but i much prefer terminal 5. spacious, light and with good dining options. as for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the a380 or the retro classic that is the b747. i'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. as an economy passenger i have found the product on british airways to be perfectly reasonable. the seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, ife screen size again is average. you get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. with emirates you have a huge ife, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. however, i've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that i have no interest in watching. i'd rather just take my ipad preloaded with films i actually want to watch. the lack of wifi isn't a huge concern for me. hopefully the gogo 2ku product ba is installing from 2017 will be more robust. now for the catering. as an economy passenger i'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with ba i have been pleasantly surprised. the food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. where ba falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. it's also the little extras that i notice. a pre-dinner drinks service. coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (as opposed to soft cheese - i'm not 5 years old). with ba you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. it's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the emirates economy offering. i've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, i've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. the recent newspaper deal with the murdoch empire is a nice touch. along with the daily hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get the times, the sun and financial times as complimentary options. arrivals for ba at dxb is a bit of a nightmare. terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. however, the new concourse d for departures is really nice. not too blingy. overall, a pleasant flight. i would happily fly with ba again.",yes
no,"i was very impressed with the world traveller plus experience on british airways from london heathrow to san francisco. obviously this is a very new aircraft for ba, but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight. i had a window seat, so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. the seat was very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the a380 which is a very quiet plane to travel in, and i enjoyed a couple of movies on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset. the food was pretty good, and alcohol freely served. the only negative experience was being turned back from priority boarding at lhr even though i have ruby status with ba. the ground agent was a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course i felt embarrassed in front of the other passengers, but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that ruby travelers had the benefit of priority boarding. i was a 10 year qualifying gold card holder on british midland, but ba has chosen to not recognise all the frequent travelers who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in executive club, however i believe this is now something they do in fact offer. this is why i have reduced my score to 8/10, otherwise full marks.",yes

no,"  verified review    vancouver to barcelona via heathrow with british airways. i would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews i've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. this however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that i'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with british airways, to be more direct i'm writing this on our final connector flight to barcelona. on february 24th, 2016 i purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from vancouver, canada to barcelona, spain. this was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a barcelona fc match. even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  april 16th, 1 day before our trip i receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" when i opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from vancouver to barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from barcelona on april 27th. as i had got home late on april 16th from cuba, i couldn't contact anyone until early morning of april 17th (my fiance's birthday). convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". we tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and i follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. we decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. this began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. we decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at yvr. the agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. she put a note on our file that an agent from jacksonville ba had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. we asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. we asked for access to the ba lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. after a very uncomfortable flight to heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). she went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. that was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. while we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats. we are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home.",no

no,"london to johannesburg, and i decided this time to fly with british airways given they fly there with the a380. i was quite looking forward to the experience of flying business class on the upper deck of the a380. i needn't have bothered. following an uneventful few hours in the galleries lounge it was time to board, straight onto the upper-deck. my business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem, however i was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - ""just a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to first which is on the lower deck - no, sorry, my mistake - you're still in business upstairs but i'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat"" (the one i'd paid the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) - but not to worry, it's still a window seat"". except it wasn't - it was seat 50a, a windowless seat next to the toilets. the journey itself was uneventful. the food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. the wine was very good. entertainment system not bad, though not a patch on the likes of emirates. the staff friendly and efficient enough and i managed to sleep a few hours. i wrote to ba to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn’t. i had to chase up twice for a reply. the one i eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people’s seats for operational needs the biggest issue for me with ba’s club world however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other’s legs - i don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves ba well behind the competition. although not my favourite airline, ba could do worse than take a note of their partners iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. the situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. can’t help but think that ba have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of a380s. whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, ba has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in club world upstairs and 8 downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. i should have known better having flown on one of ba’s other new additions to its fleet last year, a boeing 787 to toronto, which also was extremely claustrophobic. i returned home from south africa upstairs on a boeing 747 from cape town to london. the plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant. this journey ironically took me up to silver membership, i won't be choosing to fly long-haul with ba again however, unless i have to. there are far better alternatives out there.",no
no,"  verified review    i am writing to complain about my deeply distressing british airways flight from london heathrow - cape town with a change at johannesburg. the flight was badly managed throughout. when i arrived at heathrow, i was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. she eventually found it, she then said 'oh im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.' i was obviously distressed by this as imagined i would have to return back to dorset? however, after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. i arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to johannesburg. however we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. in this time, there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. once on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that 'sorry for the inconvenience, but ba did not have enough time to the the engineering works, or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day.' so we were extremely late in setting off from heathrow. i think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. i was concerned about catching my next flight from johannesburg to cape town. the flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of ba ground staff to help us all when we arrive at johannesburg. however, this could not have been further from the truth. once landed there were no british airways staff present - except for one lady in a high vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to run to the next gate for the flight. she then pointed at a man (he was wearing no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. we literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? i gave him £5 but was extremely suprised that i would have to 'tip' someone who supposedly ba advised me to go withonce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets, and rudely shouted at me as to 'why? did you leave your luggage' by this point i had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. she then told us to 'just go back' with no further help. luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the ba check in desk to ask for new tickets to cape town. once at the ba deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. they simply told me to go and get my luggage from a 'menzies' which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. i ran too and fro the menzies (lost luggage) to the comair and ba office - back and forth for around 2 hours. no staff were helpful even though i was crying and feeling completely bewildered.

no,"  verified review    we have flown with british airways over 100 times, usually in business class. on our current ski trip we paid a substantial premium to fly one way in first and home from london to denver in business class. yesterday our flight was cancelled due to snow. this of course is not their fault. after spending nearly an hour on hold to their “gold card” premium service line we were told that all the flights are full so they cannot help. we are “not authorised to help with this on the telephone, you have to drive to the airport and ask (“beg”) the airport staff to consider using a different carrier to help get you home” - for a long planned family easter holiday. the true test of a company is not when things are going well, it is what they do when there is a problem. ba.com have been truly appalling. the email cancelling our flight did not even include a phone number to call for rebooking.",no
no,"  verified review    british airways from seattle to johannesburg via london heathrow. first leg sea to lhr was on a 747. the plane was satisfactory to me. i don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. i sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52a) in the tail. the food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. i would buy seat 52a again if i was traveling on a british airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52a that you can lean on to sleep. second leg was on an a380. i sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82a. this time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. the a380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. the upper cabin on an a380 is amazingly quiet. the food on this leg was far better with an english breakfast served prior to landing in jo-burg. i would not play for seat 82a again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82a that limit foot room, but i would play for seat 82b, which is an aisle seat. ife on both legs was pretty sad but i'm not one for popular culture. cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. ba ground personnel at heathrow were very nice and helpful. i've traveled between south africa and north america about a dozen times over the past two years. flights that require you to change planes in the middle east or europe fly over africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activity dies down. nonstop flights that are routed over the atlantic ocean tend to be much smoother.",yes
no,"abu dhabi to heathrow. seating narrow and uncomfortable but seems to be the norm with this aircraft with most airlines. cabin crew excellent, but when they move friends or british airways employees from economy to premium economy or business class after boarding is complete they should do so discreetly without fare paying passengers noticing. the food served has declined in quality and quantity. the english breakfast used to be one of the best meals in economy on ba. now there is no bacon in it but rubbery mushrooms and the scrambled egg equally rubbery. truly awful meal. flight on time and entertainment system getting better. at least the screens on this newer aircraft are bigger than those on the ancient 747's still operated by british airways.",yes

no,the british airways outbound flight from london to hong kong was on a 3 year old a380. we sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. on the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. the 5 year old boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. the crew on all flights were fine but nothing special. just performed their job but never really seemed to go out of their way.,yes

(my french is minimal, so i'd have been lost) the manager told me to keep our boarding passes and receipt amd claim ba for the taxi. my son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, i claimed for a refund. alas, the computer said a big fat no. it was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights i explained that it was a ba manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. but still, no. our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! ok, legally, ba may be in the right, but morally, well. even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway. after all, we were delayed due to a cancelled flight - their fault. usually ba are brilliant when we fly with them and i cannot fault any of the frontline staff. just that blooming computer. so i am 80 euros down on the taxi and 32 euros for a transfer i couldn't use.",yes

no,"this was the return leg of our british airways flight on ba056 from johannesburg to london heathrow on 18th january. while the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. she is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. british airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. is this really the way ba wants its customers to feel? being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. after all, isn't it us, the customers, who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline. check in crew at johannesburg could also do with training on manners and smiling - instead of zero greeting, no ""thank you's"" and blank faces.",no

no,"british airways from vienna to newcastle via heathrow return, flights on-time. economy on an a320. fa’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on vie legs the fa’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. a snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the vie flights and crisps/biscuits on the ncl flights. additional drinks on request. a320 featured the new slim seats and i miss the older more comfortable ba seats with better leg room. ba has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs eur 18). if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping eur 75 at the airport or eur 35 online. being oneworld sapphire does not help either. no privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. so, ba became a low cost model, except for drinks service. however the prices do not reflect this change in service. on the last leg lhr-vie carry-on luggage was heavily policed. although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous ba flights, i was required to check it in. it was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. however, here goes the main advantage of ba, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. another thing is, that recent changes in ba’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly club on long distance routes. obviously, ba is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. while i stopped flying business with ba probably a year ago after they downgraded their club europe cabin and i was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, i believe ba’s european economy was a great product and i was using ba regularly for those flights. however, after all these recent changes, i will only book ba if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. for flights to the uk, klm starts to look pretty good again.

no,"i have been flying to the us regularly from england and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process, website, call centre and ground staff. the british airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak english and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. examples: cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except i wanted a printed boarding pass). call centre staff in india wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number ""for security reasons"". no problem with ""security reasons"" when i paid ba a lot of money for the ticket. upgrading with points or avios fails in the middle of a transaction. the system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. ba blacks out so many flights from purchasing with avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. in the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. on another occasion at passport control after checking in i was directed back to the ba desk i'd just come from. ""there's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be baa. it's not us"", was the response. it took a huffing, tutting, ba duty manager to run the visa check again. i advise people to avoid ba if possible. the only reason for choosing ba is flight safety. but other airlines manage that too, with a smile. so, no excuse.",no

no,"i have flown british airways business class and was pleased with lounge, food service, elemis spa, showers wit elemis products and on request champagne. onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- a380) clean and comfortable. my next trip in august was last minute with just first available. i felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. my past experiences with first prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- i felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. so, with all the changes in first now, i thought i would really be in for a relaxing treat. i want to preface this by saying i have always loved british airways and has always been my first choice for london- houston, jfk-london flights for years. i had a early flight. checked in in ample time before my flight. i went straight to the concorde room to have breakfast. what i was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. there was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. i met an english couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. it all went downhill from there. the wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. i carried some dishes to the front just so i could be seated. boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. it looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. the the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. he offered a men's toiletry kit and a business class kit. the food was served. i started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and i am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. then the entrees were short and i had to choose a second choice. any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting i paid for first and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  business class wins out hands down. the food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. the pilot did come out and asked if ba could call me and he was very apologetic (i guess a steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - i consented. disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. it left me feeling that ba really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. my flight back to jfk i flew business. it was comfortable. though there was less space in first class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. i am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. my review is for first only.",no

no,"washington to dubai via london return with british airways. my concern is regarding seat allocation. when we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. we then chose 3 seats together on the side. i presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. i asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". that was not the case, unfortunately. the flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. i do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. british airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. the priority seating chart is for that purpose useful.

no,"i think one word sums it up 'rubbish'. the london to barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. it started at grantley adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. we sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so i had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. there were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents i would presume. next the food, abysmal! a choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. the tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. i have travelled with british airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. many years ago when i used to travel from singapore and malaysia with british airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. the cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. i asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. i did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance. british airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as emirates and singapore airlines, although sadly not on the barbados route.

no,"british airways first class seats are very good compared to their business class. truly a great experience. loving the windows, there’s a cover that can open, shade or close. the pods are quite private. 1-2-1 configuration.  service very attentive and personal. they will address you by name the moment you walk in, escort you to your seat and supply welcome drinks, towels, etc. food is reasonable to good. if you don’t like (parts) of the meals, you can replace from (parts) of other sets, turning it in fact into semi- a-la-carte. return flight was over-booked. by phone and email they contacted me and with my permission i was rebooked onto 1st class sq flight at same day at more or less the same time.  in all, it was a very pleasant experience.  the singapore lounge does not have a 1st class section and is mixed with business class. fare difference between business class and 1st class is not as huge as with some other airlines. definitely recommended.

no,"i was among the several hundred passengers whose british airways flight was canceled last night from dallas ft worth to london. no status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. they were not updated. people were told to call 1-800-airways for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. one woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. one couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. they were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. the couple will now miss half their cruise. no screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. there were two other flights out to lhr that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, i missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. it did not help that the british airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. i was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. people were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. the customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. no attempt to ""take a number"" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. the counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. the way british airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. i am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. i will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to india, and my traveling companion (coming from atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female. this airline has cost me time, money, and most importantly safety, for myself and my friend.",no

no,"my wife and i recently flew to california, outbound on a380 into lax, returning to lhr from sfo on boeing 747-400. both legs in wt+ (premium economy). the boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who ba seemingly are not investing in at all. the plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. despite ba insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the a380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal wt (economy). not helped by the multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. the tv screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the a380. on the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as wt+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. i feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of wt) with the word ""premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. ba do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. additionally, despite ba boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the wt+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! as you can tell, overall i feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. based upon our experience, i would recommend the wt+ in the a380 but only when departing from the uk (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). in addition, wt+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. these may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.",no

no,"vienna to london heathrow return in september 2015, both flights in economy on an a320. crew pleasant but not doing more than absolutely required. a snack and drinks were served on both legs. this time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun. edible, but not ba´s best sandwich offering.  additional drinks were served on request. both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. while the seat are slightly better than the recaro slim seats, i miss the older more comfortable seats with better leg room. i did not really realize that ba has changed the rules recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs eur 18). also, if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping eur75 at the airport or eur35 on line.  the final fare with ba can be substantially higher than the initial price quote - the additional charges are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process, the charges are lower. with the exception of a free drink and sandwich, british airways economy product is now pretty much a low-cost airline product. being oneworld sapphire does not help either. no privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checking luggage. while vie-lhr was on time, the return lhr-vie leg was delayed for one hour. after a timely boarding the full plane was waiting for the departure, but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot, which meant waiting an hour for a new slot. so, basically ba inconvenienced a whole plane of passengers to load some delayed cargo. flying with hand baggage only, i used web check-in for both flights which worked fine. boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. ba uses a shared lounge in vie. the lounge as such is acceptable (small and mostly packed), but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. the selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounges in vie. ba galleries lounge in lhr t3 a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drinks selection was better than vie. wine selection was nice. ba still uses t3 for its flights to vie, which i consider a huge benefit over using t5, which tends to be a mess for passengers. while i stopped flying british airways business in europe they ba changed business seating to economy seats with no additional legroom, i see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product, but i still consider ba one of the better options for economy flights in europe. however their new low-cost airline concept also means that the times when i was willing to pay higher prices just for flying with ba over easyjet or austrian on this route are unfortunately over.",yes

no,"london heathrow to dubai in british airways first class. the trip got off to a good start with the concorde lounge at terminal 5. very comfortable and private, however showing signs of wear and tear. needs a bit of a refurb. boarding was announced and we promptly left, however only just made it to the gate. (very odd, but i am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding.) the plane was a very old refurbished boeing 747-400. quite why ba hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. i estimate the plane, over its life so far, has done about 90 million miles (enough to get to the moon). much criticism has been said about cramming so many first suites into the nose of the plane, and i can say that is fully justified. it was a day flight so not worried about sleeping, but if it were a night flight as a tall (but not overweight) man i would struggle to get comfortable. it’s like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. a cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer boeing 747-400s for another 5-10 years. if so, this is truly unbelievable. given the emirates competition on this route, their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar, one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at british airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. there is so much criticism of british airways on this site, one wonders why they don’t listen. it can only be perceived as arrogance. food was fine. very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy middle eastern style chicken; not bad at all. champagne very basic and krug has long vanished from british airways routes. cabin crew were terrific – faultless. travelling a boeing 777 on the way back. hopefully a better seat.",no

no,"on the upper deck on ba 282 (aug 31st), although the equipment is relatively new, once you are in those hideous seats, you wouldn't be aware of what aircraft you are on. squeezing as many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a premium cabin experience. british airways missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product, but while other carriers improved their cabins, ba seem content in leading the race to the bottom. the crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. the child's parents were certainly mare tolerant than i would have been. crew turned a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still climbing and the seat belt signs were still illuminated. once the food was served, crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast was served. due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip, i ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offerings were on this sector. the 'club kitchen' is a complete waste of time. i did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight (after negotiating the outstretched legs of a sleeping passenger) but the unlabeled sandwiches were chilled out of their existence and were inedible. british airways really need to up their game in respect of offering a premium cabin service.",no
no,"i can confirm what has been reported earlier about british airways long haul flights. our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. the tv screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an ikea couch from the 1970's. the usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. on top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the uk. disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - british airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! we had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight. this was definitely the last flight with british airways.",no

no,"a very smooth and pleasant flight from start to finish. the bag drop queue at terminal 5 was long but moved reasonably fast. onboard a small snack of crisps and a drink was served, which was fine. the flight operated on time. my only quibble was that a label was put on my backpack instructing me to keep it at my feet, presumably so that other people with unreasonably large take-on bags could easily put them in the overhead bins (while i suffered less legroom than them). apart from the safety issue of hand baggage stuck on the floor, this policy penalises people who do the right thing and encourages others to take big items of ""hand"" luggage. come on, ba, enforce a your hand luggage rules and don't penalise considerate passengers.",yes

no,"first time travelling in a premium class so compared with economy it was great. check-in at lhr was quick and we were grateful of the additional baggage allowance in club europe. the fast track through security was also welcome. the galleries lounge in t3 was excellent, we were welcomed and given a quick overview of the lounge. the breakfast in the lounge offered everything from cereal to pastries to hot sandwiches, as well as tea, coffee, juice, water and a wide selection of alcohol. there was also a great view of the runway which my son enjoyed. the service on board the flight itself offered hot towels prior to take off, then a full english breakfast with real cutlery and plates, warm bread rolls and choice of drinks. the legroom was excellent and the seat was comfortable. they are laid out in the same 3x3 configuration as economy but the middle seat has a table over it which gives you extra room to place your items. as you are near the front of the plane, disembarkation was quick and we were at the carousel before our cases. the return journey was much the same, and although the lounge at bcn did not offer anywhere near such a good selection of food, the seating was far superior to lhr. the meal on the way back was a selection of spanish meats with, cheese, olives and a spicy mousse, together with the usual selection of drinks. we were able to use the fast track through passport control at lhr which avoided a long queue and meant we were out of the airport and in our car within an hour. overall this was a fantastic experience for me and my family who usually travel in economy.",yes
no,"i wish i could comment on the service on the aircraft, but with a 27 hour delay i am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. it is not the technical fault i am worried about but the way the problem was handled by ba's ground staff at johannesburg's or tambo airport. the cabin crew had arrived at 18.00hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at 19.20hrs to london. at 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. the chaos then started. people close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). after about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where ba staff would be there to assist. got to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. a series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. nobody was directing passengers at each stage. passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said south african airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. the line slinked back into the arrivals area. only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. chaotic scenes. no line for families or premium passengers. in the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. no clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. all airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. in this case there was nobody in charge, nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. a true shambles. passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only). flying club and having a ba gold card (with gold list status) meant nothing.",no

no,"i am a silver card holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. up to 2 months ago i was loyal to ba as it is an 'english airline with english values' but this loyalty was unfounded. my main issue now with ba is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. on frequent trips to dubai with ba on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that ba has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. the seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. the arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. the inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. on short haul flights, in business (lhr-mun), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. the seats are lightweight. uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without ac on. my worst experience was trying to fly back to munich from london. it was an old a320. as we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. on landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. this i feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to london departed. we then had to stand around for 2 hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. i would not recommend ba at present, even the new a380 i flew on to la had so many faults and badly thought through. i will miss the easy access of terminal 5 and lounges that i earned through loyalty as many other customers do. however the age, quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer.

no,"i am a regular user of ba and generally find the airline to be ok but not outstanding. this flight was fairly full , departed on time and check in was very quick. in my opinion the 747 fleet of ba needs either replacement of extensive refurbishment, these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior. the seats were past their prime and quite uncomfortable. the food offering was very poor, no fresh items either at dinner or for breakfast. staff were ok, punctuality was good and baggage delivery although not fast was acceptable. inflight entertainment was good but the tv screens are from a previous age with quite poor quality",yes
no,"the flight left on time and arrived early, which was great. the b747-400 fleet of ba needs either replacement or complete refit of the interiors. the aircraft was old and looked it. the food was pretty standard but compared with our earlier cape town to london flight much better and more complete, why the lack of consistency is unclear. the inflight entertainment offering is good but the tv screens are small and worn delivering poor quality images. staff were excellent, efficient and friendly and went out of their way to make the journey more pleasant",yes
no,"the outgoing flight was fine, the return flight was cancelled due to an issue with the plane. i understand this happen as i am a seasoned traveller, however what happened next was unacceptable and what you would expect from a low class airline. we were handed tickets for an american airlines flight from a different o'hare terminal and told ""you have to go now"". the terminal was in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour. getting boarding passes and going again through security was another hour or so but the flight was delayed and left two hours late. flight was very mediocre and not what i had paid for with ba. we arrived in london and guess what - no bags, even though we spent more than 5 hours in chicago airport and were assured our bags were on the flight. that was sunday now it is tuesday, no on has contacted us and no updates.",no
no,"the seat that i had booked 24 hours in advance (a window seat) had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin, i complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full. once onboard i discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. the in-flight entertainment or the vod (video on demand) system apeared to be vhs and was broken for my seat, one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. the screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. the food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. as this was an overnight flight i expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted, any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. the boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of ba's airbus a380's or boeing 747 flights. i had an excellent flight out on ba and an amazing stay in washington d.c but the flight back put a dent in the enjoyment of the holiday.",no
no,"ba shorthaul business class is now nothing more than a con. the seat is the same size as in economy, barely 29 inch seat pitch, so no extra legroom for the extra money being paid. the middle seat is blocked, but they then go and stick a table in it making it not only hard to get in and out of the window seat, but also no thought to emergency evacuation situations as it is alomst impossible to collapse the seat down - it took 3 fas when i asked them and almost 10 minutes. why does ba put these awful tables in? nobody uses them and when i complained to ba, i was told ""don't sit in a window seat"" - what sort of customer relations is that. never again ba business class shorthaul for me, i have flown many years with them including holding a ff gold card for 3 years and numerous silver cards. as i said at the beginning - nothing more than a con.",no
no,"what has happened to ba in recent years? it has been a long time since i ventured onto their long haul flights, and after this trip i will steer very clear again and stay with cathay pacific and japan airlines. airport service in narita is always good - because it is not ba providing the service. but for the rest of the trip, simply awful. the seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only ba boss to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the ""good"" airlines now offer in business class. the cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive japanese fa. british airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it seems that most british customers select them simply because they are british - anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that ba is now well down the quality list, and it is about time skytrax downgraded them to 3-star airline maximum - they do not meet 4-star. ba markets itself as this slick, british style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many uk companies and uk departments stipulate ba as a no 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. if you're proud to be british, i would recommend you give ba a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards. as a closing point, i recently travelled china southern airlines on my outbound sector to guangzhou, and they are streets ahead of ba in almost every element, excepting some language skills.",no

no,"considering ba's fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our british son in law. plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. we flew premium economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. flight crew was fine and professional. inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. cabin and seats were clean and neat. inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  they offer pillows and blankets. but although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. the meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. not a lot of choices, to london, beef or pasta, from london back to la, it was beef or fish. it was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. roll butter and dessert but i'm not sure i'd say it was what ba's advertisement claims. it didn't feel it was a premium meal. they also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. the entire plane was dark. the second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. on the return to la, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. the flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from germany. they lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight friday, we weren't notified by ba until saturday afternoon. we ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. if we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. poor communication on their part. not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. i guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all. i doubt we'd fly ba again sadly i'd hoped for something special.",no
no,"we flew business class to vienna on the 28/7/15, terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. there was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. the outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. i think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. however the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. the attitude of the staff was really below par. the food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. seeing the choice i asked for the vegetarian option-couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  when asked would i like a drink i replied - bloody mary. i should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any ws. i asked if i could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown. ba need to remember we as the customers pay their wages.",no

no,"british airways business class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. what once made ba a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. on this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent i have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, i was served the first course. i did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and i was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. we did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. unfortunately ba has the only non-stop flight between cape town and london, but next time i will fly emirates via dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.",no

no,"i have flown in business class with ba on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. if you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. i have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example emirates, eva or lan chile, quite the opposite. anyway, ba were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my vancouver-heathrow flight. i thought i'd try it. it was a waste of money. the first sign of trouble was the fact that i was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must i think. then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on ba, i am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. the wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when i asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. i eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. i thought 'oh no, surely not in first'. well, i was wrong. i was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. after that, unbelievably, i was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. i asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off i went back to my seat. when i was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that ba don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, i couldn't believe my ears. as for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,i felt cramped. the mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. the in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. i know this reads like a demolition job on ba but i have made no exaggerations. i really think willie walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. he'd find out for himself. i want ba to be the best and it simply isn't. lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of ba business class is shared by every other person i have ever mentioned it to. if you're flying ba stay in business class, you're not missing anything.",no
no,"this review is written due to what i feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. the first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff i have ever come across. the lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. no priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. food ok not first class, wines good. the entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. the seat would not lie flat and hard to move. bought on board duty free and asked would i need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. had to clear immigration although not entering the uk, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free i bought on board could not go through i would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. this was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. flight to dublin short, salad served and tea. priority bags were the last bags on the belt. overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. i fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. ba you have lost your edge, i will stay loyal to qatar, emirates and cathay pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. my advice do not waste your money with ba, it's service cutting to the point of insult.",no

no,"having read many reviews on here i was somewhat sceptical about flying club world with ba, however, i was pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this 13 hour flight to kuala lumpur. we had front row seats 10a and 10b, 10a window seat is reverse facing and 10b is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. we were concerned that seat 10b would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10a gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11b to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. the food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. i would be happy to travel ba club world again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10ab or 10jk, but i do prefer the upper deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old jumbo, i'm not a lover of the new a380.",yes

no,"ba staff were excellent from the start to the finish. service onboard was friendly, professional, and helpful. my wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at heathrow, and the ba flight attendant personally travelled from terminal 3 to terminal 5 to hand deliver it back to her. if you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. that exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so ba get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and i. snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the business class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that ba should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. they were standard economy class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. to convert these to business class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.",yes

no,"our night flight was delayed by nearly an hour; not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with ba on this flight (17th june 2015). we paid extra for our premium economy tickets, then extra again to reserve seats, and past experience with ba and with equivalent seats/service on virgin atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. not this flight, however, where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. we were last to board after first, business and economy. where customers in premium economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice, now it is water or juice. once we had taken off, drinks were served; fine, but when the steward came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked the glass onto the floor, where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps? i was made to feel that the breakage was my fault! dinner did not arrive until after 11pm, by which time i had rather lost interest, as had my partner. so far, our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine (i was not offered a second, possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass). overnight, by contrast to other night flights, the lights were never fully dimmed; there were no offers of water/orange juice to prevent dehydration. the promised (on the menu card) morning 'light snack' and coffee/tea/fruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of dried-up cake and a weak coffee - no mention of fruit juice. i couldn't really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's fully reclined seat. i will not, if at all possible, be travelling with ba again. it left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday.",no
no,"check in at tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of ba flights) i was told there are no ba staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. as a ba silver card holder, i joined the business queue. first one lady had considerably too much baggage. the arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. after 20 more minutes i asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. this was not possible, i was told. eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! looking forward to a drink in the lounge, i then discover there is no lounge airside. as for the lhr-ord flight, i have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. to board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. this is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. the worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. the meal was ok and the ife had a decent selection of movies. but overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. with some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31"", ba has lost my future business.",no

no,"once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. the cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. seating on a319 was comfortable for a short flight. at gla airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. this is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. one sees easyjet and ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker.",yes
no,"disappointed. the food was poor, my wife's steak could have been anything, my curry had a tiny piece of chicken. the cabin was less than half full but cabin crew hadn't time to bring a glass of wine. after the meal, staff disappeared. no after dinner drink offered, no refreshments during the night. for the price this could have been a lot better. return on old b747 was better.",no
no,"this is my 3rd flight with ba in 8 months and  the worst yet. the customer service and communication is appalling. originally my return flight was from rome to london gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at rome airport. but instead of ba getting in contact with me in regards to this, the third party company i booked the flights with had to. when checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. when i  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though i called the customer service number. this is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising. but as a result of the rudeness, lack of communication and appalling customer service i'm very unlikely to ever use them again.

no,"british airways never fails to surprise. i find the business lounge in geneva quite reasonable and on this last occasion was impressed with the manner in which the lounge manager handled a cranky passenger who was accusing him of destroying her favourite newspapers. then, once on-board, i discovered that business class on some of ba's european routes have a seat-pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seats! for those used to flying qantas domestic economy in australia think of a forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty: and that's it! on the other hand, service and food was excellent and the flight crew commentary was superb. ba have an excellent in-flight magazine.",yes
no,"flight was delayed 2 hours - i was given reasonable notice, but then had to rearrange my connecting flight and ended up with a lot more time at heathrow than i would have liked. check-in was fine, and cabin staff attentive, food average - but i do have an issue with space. the 747 fuselage tapers at the back - there's not enough room for 3-4-3 seating, and rows 51 on have 2-4-2 configuration. rows 49/50 don't have enough room for 3-4-3 seating either, but ba do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. i endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats, my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. this is just not acceptable for a long-haul flight, especially at night - ba charges extra for seats identified as having more room, by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cash-back offered for anyone prepared to accept them (small children, perhaps).",no

no,"lhr-ncl-lhr. i was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning i was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so i could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. i managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed i had to now arrange last minute accommodation, i thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the ba app. what it didn't tell me was that the flight i re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as i received a a text/app notification telling me so - i think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and i spent a couple of hours getting to know terminal 5. the general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. the plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and i liked the simple but elegant cabin. ba staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. cabin crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other airlines. sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.",no

no,"after flying many, many, times, i can honestly say this was the worst plane i have ever flown in. the aircraft was old and falling apart. during the flight the handle of the toilet flew off, one of the overhead bins was loose and the table holding the bassinette was broken. the carpet was threadbear and the equipment was being held together with tape. they did not have enough food, and nothing available for me (i have a nut allergy), the food that was served, was not fit for human consumption. the toilets were not cleaned during the whole flight (13 hours), and as a result the smell from there was disgusting. the rubbish bin was overflowing with waste, which included soiled nappies. the only time we saw the cabin crew was when they were serving food. they looked very scruffy, not what you would expect of a ba cabin crew. all in all a very unpleasant flight. i travel to asia every year and will ensure i never fly ba on this route again.",no
no,"very good flight in club world from start to finish. ok, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly british) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. the lie flat bed (i took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. the food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and i was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. there was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and tv shows. i fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more luxury feel, however ba scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping. i also visited the heathrow t3 arrivals lounge which is first class. i will definitely fly ba club world again if the price is competitive.",yes

no,"this is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with ba longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. i highly rate ba for families. on our travels i have found the ba staff inflight: 1) to be sympathetic towards my wife and i with having infants. they have offered quiet areas during service (on the a380) to help settle our baby. left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. crew are not servants to passengers. they have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but i find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. they are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. it figures. i am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach silver tier on an annual basis. having bc check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. the greatest perk is that as silver i get 2 bags at 32kg each. not only that but when i travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as i do and our infant gets 23kg bag. plus car seats and pram free. that is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. ba are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, i have no issues with them and find them value for money. i could not care less what the food is like. i fly to be on time and get good connections. heathrow t5 is great.",yes

no,flew from heathrow to san francisco on may 1st with ba. what a disappointment! i had to pay over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was ok typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. would i fly ba again certainly not long haul although unfortunately i have to return to heathrow with them from boston today.,yes

no,lhr-yyz in world traveller plus (upgrade) in a 777 yyz-lhr in economy in a 747. i got an upgrade for the outbound flight which was a bonus. there were a few niggles on the outbound flight. sound cancelling headphones but the sound quality was poor even at maximum volume. the reading light worked but was inadequate (probably because it was too far away). the cabin temperature was a little erratic and there were queues for the four toilets in economy (it could have been a problem if we had been flying through prolonged turbulence). but as i said these were just niggles - i enjoyed the upgrade and the flight. the return was delayed and the apu unserviceable (not uncommon with a 747). we had to wait for a second air starter unit (if it requires twos order them in advance) and it got rather stuffy whilst waiting. the pilot kept us informed of what was happening. once underway it was a good flight and i rested well. cheerful and efficient crew in both directions. food was good outbound and adequate inbound. some areas for improvement but overall very good and would recommend ba.,yes
no,ba873 krk-lhr 17 may - a new sector launched just early this month and my first time flying ba. i was pleasantly surprised (for my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while i paid for check-in luggage. i understood why in the end. my biggest gripe has to be that the sunday flight departs and arrives late into lhr. this was worsened by the fact that it was a full flight but the overhead bins were already full before all were on board hence there was a 20 minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to be put in the hold. unfortunately flight did not manage to catch up while in the air hence we landed 20 minutes late cutting it close to the curfew time for lhr. we had to run all the way through and almost missed the last heathrow express train. i will never fly a late flight into lhr again. that said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining - quite chatty over the pa and with some passengers though not necessarily friendly to all customers. 2.5 hours on an a320 passed by without any in-flight entertainment (to be expected for regional flights) and with some food and refreshments (which were good).,yes
no,zrh-lhr. a bit of a disaster. my flight ba 719 was delayed 90 minutes - and so was the preceding flight. so one is acceptable - two is well a co-incidence. (or not). left 90 minutes late (about 20 minutes) after the earlier late departure got stacked over kent - landing about 2 hours late - from a 80 minutes flight. plane was almost brand new. crew was great - but in the end couldn't care less. ba at its worst. pathetic.,no
no,a380 lhr-iad. after a visit to the concorde room the mood was set to enjoy this flight which we did. the attendants were friendly helpful and attentive. the food and drinks were good though my wife was disappointed with her tasting plate. as expected the seats and space were appropriate and comfortable. the journey started and finished on schedule. there was not a great deal of difference between this flight and a a380 in j on qantas so whilst no complaints i don't believe the additional cost are value for money.,no
no,club world: just flown london gatwick to las vegas in club world and very disappointed. staff were not particularly helpful gave the impression that everything they did they were doing you a favour. the seating of 2/4/2 in a business cabin is unfair trying to pack too many people in. they didn't offer anything to try to make you feel a bit special and i had paid a lot of money for the tickets. i normally fly virgin atlantic on this route and will defiantly be using them in the future.,yes
no,"we travelled on flight ba11 from heathrow to singapore on 25th july 2014 and it is most unlikely we would travel with them again. we were supposed to depart at 2000 and had arrived early to escape the rush and heat of london. when we checked the departures board we noticed no gate number had been allotted to our flight. we hung around gate a area and waited for further advice and waited and waited. the clock ticked on and we all waited for the advice the board is supposed to display. come 1920 (supposed to be boarding) and still no gate number or advice as to the delayed boarding. i could go on and on but finally at 2008 (yes 8 minutes after scheduled departure time!) the board declared that we had to go to gate b area for a 2100 departure. still no explanation as to why we were an hour late. we caught the transit service and headed over there finally boarding the plane after the rescheduled departure time. the air conditioning was virtually non-functional and we were forced to sit in the stinking heat waiting for some sort of explanation and apology. the staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near us at the rear of the plane refused two requests from passengers to bring water using the defence that she was ""on my own back here and cannot leave my post"". incredibly she left her post several times when it suited her to talk to other stewards etc! about 2110 the captain announced that they had ""lost a passenger and we should depart within 10-15 minutes"". finally at 2221 we took off after sitting in the terrible heat and humidity of all those bodies for over an hour with no service of drinks or anything else after boarding over an hour late! yes we departed 2 hours and 21 minutes late and still without explanation or apology of any kind from any of the staff! the air conditioning did not start to reduce the temperature until more than 3 hours into the flight! when we landed at singapore the captain announced that he ""hoped the ongoing passengers hadn't been too inconvenienced by the hold-up"". i guess that was ba's apology? totally disgraceful ba andwe still don't know why we were delayed.",no
no,punta cana - gatwick. world traveller plus cabin on b777. i find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. the front row of world traveller pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. ife was ok but nothing special. main meal was ok but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. no alternatives offered. i know this is not business class but for the premium i paid for world traveller plus i feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. the drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. then nothing until breakfast. regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. when in all innocence i used a toilet in the business class cabin i found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when i emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. fair enough but when i explained that other passengers in world traveller plus had also used the toilets in business class i was virtually called a liar. i backed off from an argument but i found the experience upsetting and i simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. i eventually disembarked at lgw hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. in summary world traveller plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.,no
no,"after a recent flight to st lucia with ba if i have a choice in future i will fly with another airline. from the start of the return trip we experienced problems. headset failed to work on reporting this to the cabin crew i was informed that ""you need to jiggle it to make a connection"" so needed to unpack my own kit to watch a movie. meal time the only choice left was pasta one with cheese and one without the passenger next to me had the pasta it looked like it had been re-heated with the cover off very hard. on mentioning it to the cabin staff all she got was ""their cutting down"" in all areas. re the movie this picture quality was a disgrace picture and sound kept braking up i switched my phone on and again used my own music to get me through the 8 hours trip. i have cancelled my ba membership.",no
no,sadly flying british airways is no longer about a great experience - it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for. we had a number of issues that we tried to get resolved via customer services but were told they couldn't do anything until our journey had ended? we were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issues during our journey. ba staff at heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage (causing big issues) the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes. the breakfast on our return flight wasn't fit for consumption - an ice cold hard croissant after 7 hours of no food? really poor service and even worse customer services.,no
no,i treated myself to premium economy on my pek-lhr flight ba38 because it was only an extra £120 and i had been on holiday to north korea and wanted a bit of luxury. i was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the pe cabin was not very full. the cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the economy food just with a fancy menu card. i was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and i got a lot of sleep even though it was a daytime flight. the ife malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on ba 747s. staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.,no
no,i flew lhr-pek for a holiday on a 747-400. the plane was not that busy and the seat next to me was free which was great. the plane was clean and my seat was reasonably comfortable. the ife had a good selection although the small screens on the 747 now look out of date. the meal was fine for economy class and the staff were polite and attentive.,yes
no,first off this particular flight from ewr to lhr and back was advertised as a boeing 787 dreamliner. the actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. the flight going to london was 3 hours delayed coming into ewr something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in boston ma. in fact they had not allocated a crew. coming home my pre-paid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to w'c's so i had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. i was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. fact: i did get back to the usa. reality: ba no more - never again. the problem with ba is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. the problem is that their customer service is a joke. cannot recommend this airline.,yes
no,ba2204/5 lgw-puj-lgw b777-200er. both flights excellent comfortable seats tasty meals both ways and friendly cabin crew. lucky to get upgrade to wtp on return flight very nice ba at its best.,no
no,ba 10 bangkok to london heathrow may 26th 2015 world traveller plus (premium economy). first the positives: check-in at bkk was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at lhr about 15 minutes early. unfortunately while world traveller plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of world traveller plus. the cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. however by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. after the first meal service (an uninspiring chicken curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the ba website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of world traveller plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. it seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. in stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on qantas to bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on ba was extremely disappointing. our advice: don't waste your money on ba world traveller plus.,yes
no,lhr-atl-lhr. out 3rd may. back 12th may. first both ways. outstanding experience. check-in and security straight through. concorde lounge - quiet and comfortable- food lovely. boarding very efficient. superb flight-seats excellent food great ife good. crew brilliant. straight through immigration. exactly same on return. 777 both ways will definitely fly with ba again. could not have been better.,yes
no,jnb-lhr ba056 may 13 2015. lhr-jnb ba055 may 23 2015 on the airbus a380. departed and landed on time. friendly flight attendants and fairly comfortable seats. food not exactly 5 star but i didn't have very high expectations either. overall no complaints at all and i will definitely fly ba again!,yes
no,lgw-her. a320 on one of ba's new tourist-orientated routes. sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' club europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. if this is the way ba are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra. they really should think again about their premium service.,no
no,gatwick to florida return flight out was quite good with an attentive crew 3 choices of meals found the seatback tv screen very small and selection of movies and audio choice was poor legroom could be a lot better too and i feel that ba need to update their b777 on this route. return flight was delayed two hours but was informed by the airline by text and email on check-in a $9 vouches was given to buy drinks or a snack i found the food on the return flight very poor with only chicken or pasta available and the breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and jam and a raisin bar that was virtually indelible i would consider flying ba to florida again if their prices are comparable to other carriers.,yes
no,gatwick-naples returning barcelona-gatwick. excellent flights as usual. especially loved the stylish and comfortable interiors of the refitted a319 on the naples run. both flights left late but it didn't seem to seriously affect arrival time. only complaint is the food/drinks service sandwich is not to my taste and i now refuse them - but other passengers seem pleased. should offer an alternative such as crisps or nuts to go with wine.,yes
no,business class tampa - gatwick. fantastic service and attentive staff. however seat 10a feels very claustrophobic you also have to step over the footrest of 11b if you want to go to the loo or take a wee walk during the flight.,yes
no,used avios to upgrade return flights to grenada. previously enjoyed this route in business class but the food choices and champagne ran out. same problem with the food choices ie only four scallop starters between 7 passengers some people might have paid the full fare of £3400. champagne flowed freely and service was excellent. slept just as well in business class engine noise seemed greater in first class and screaming baby did not help either. despite these niggles first class lived up to its name and great value for money if not paying cash for it!,yes
no,lhr-sea world traveler plus. as a ba executive club member i was able to use the club bag drop where there was no queue. the fast track security staff were disorganised and patronising. the gold/first lounge was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. boarding from the c gates was well organised. on taking my seat i was offered a water or orange juice. the 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. the situation was helped by the fact that i had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22b). departure was on time. bar service was just before and with the meal. i had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. overall the meal was quite good. the mixed fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. the seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline. the leg support cushions were useless as they did not move far enough to make contact with my legs. time passed quickly as the entertainment system was very good. a reasonable snack of sandwiches and a scone was served about an hour before landing. we arrived a the gate slightly ahead of schedule. immigration bag collection and customs were completed in under half an hour.,yes
no,lgw-cun-lgw. husband and i had middle seats both outbound and return. we found seats comfortable for seating and sleeping. crew on outbound were a lot more efficient and friendlier than the inbound crew where the service was a bit haphazard and one particular crew member who was a few years older than the others was rather offhand and didn't smile much at all. outboard there were empty seats all around us so we did not have to sit face to face with strangers or climb over anyone when leaving our seats but cabin was quite full inboard so we did not enjoy the flight as much. the club world cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabins and i do not know what ba were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seats and in such a way as to make it very awkward for less mobile passengers to exit their seats. storage space is lacking around the seats due to ba trying to fit too many passengers into too small a space. i would not say i would not travel club world with ba again but would look at alternative airlines with different cabin layouts first.,yes
no,flew from jeddah on ba132 in club world on a 777-200er. to be honest i have no complaints. meal service was fantastic. cabin crew made sure i was comfortable throughout the flight and brought drinks to keep me and other pax hydrated. cabin crew were very polite and friendly. flight departed on time and arrived at lhr ahead of schedule. would i fly ba again? of course!,yes
no,"lgw-rak-lgw may 2015. these flights were on ba's newly configured a320's we paid for emergency exit row seats on both ways and very thankful that we did british airways have reduced the legroom in both economy & business class to 30"" and at 6'1 the normal legroom now is quite tight. the seats themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seats mean you don't lose your legroom. the service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore (having travelled many times in club with ba new product is not a winner from what i could see). i would fly british airways again and would recommend them.",yes
no,blq-lgw and return. operated by a319 clean tidy and with a spacious legroom. the service at the desk and from the cabin crew was really smart and friendly. both flight were on time and both landing were great. i will fly again ba.,yes
no,flight ba72 and ba73. departed 14th may returned 20th may 2015. very impressed with flight and cabin service on our trip from dublin to muscat oman both in club europe and club world. was a bit dubious from reading other reviews however could not fault the service. our flight was not busy so maybe this helped however i am looking forward to my return trip. would book again.,yes
no,yyz-lhr-bru: first - club world: check-in in toronto was smooth with very nice and friendly ground staff. used pre-dining in lounge and i was surprised who good the food was from starter to dessert. the service was excellent too. when boarding friendly cabin staff was waiting and i was escorted to my seat. cabin crew and cabin staff director introduced themselves personally to each passenger in first class. i asked the friendly cabin crew to turn down my bed when i to put on the pyjamas so i could go to sleep. this flight was again a confirmation that the first class service improved and it has been consistent on all my last flights in first. landed on time in lhr. used the reserved cabana in concorde room and enjoyed an excellent breakfast. boarding on the full flight to brussels was a little chaotic but it was an excellent flight with fantastic cabin crew decent food and a clean plane.,yes
no,travelled with my wife from barbados to london gatwick on tuesday's overnight flight. boarding by row numbers was well co-ordinated. staff on board were polite and efficient. seat in premium economy is relatively comfortable. the extra space is appreciated for longer flights. food is still below standard was served a breakfast pineapple yoghurt which i had to eat with a plastic knife! flight arrived 15 mins early. will fly with ba again.,yes
no,lgw-agp club europe. ground staff were very cheerful and friendly. told them i lost my boarding pass and was reissued another one. ba business lounge in gatwick was good but could be better. a little crowded. boarding was very quick. cabin crew were friendly and enthusiastic. drinks and nuts offered straight after take off. afternoon tea followed. more drinks offered. cabin crew interacted with passengers. landing was very smooth and arrived 10 minutes early. aircraft used was a little old but the cabin gave the aircraft a young feel.,yes
no,over the last couple of years i have travelled to china by emirates klm virgin atlantic and ba. the next time i travel ba will be my last choice. i got the impression from the very start that ba are penny pinching at every opportunity. their lounges are basic and the food minimal. although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. the cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. if you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.,yes
no,travelled from heathrow to washington in april on one of the new a380 planes. extremely impressed with the plane even in economy the seats are quite spacious and the storage buckets at the side of the seat are a big plus. the service on board was good and the meals were pretty good. the plane arrived exactly on time too! all in all one of the best flights i've had.,yes
no,lhr to istanbul - excellent service on the outbound flight on what was a very busy flight. cabin crew worked very hard and consistently. good management on the ground and for boarding excellent cabin crew. t5 lounge ok but breakfast food soon ran out and rather slow in service.,yes
no,brilliant service from the cabin crew and captain/first officer on this much delayed lisbon-lhr flight. ba have questions to answer - another lisbon-lhr flight which was heavily delayed (this happens regularly) another ba flight from lisbon with a remote boarding location and poor management prior to boarding. our two hour delay - all after we had boarded - was handled brilliantly by the crew with regular communication refreshments and as jovial atmosphere as was possible. but ba must face up to the astonishingly poor lounge in lisbon the poor management of boarding and a limp response to questions.,yes
no,business class. scheduled to fly from rome to gatwick on 7 may on ba2543. the day that the fire broke out at rome airport. we had a 12.45pm flight. i received a text from ba at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact ba. i called them and they rebooked us on flight ba555 at 8.15pm but direct to heathrow. we accepted the flight change considering and lounged around rome for the morning. than when about to get the train to rome airport received a text from ba advise that flight had been changed to naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to naples. so we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in naples. the flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to naples. i think the communication and the effect that ba did to get us out of rome under the circumstances was excellent. a friend was flying to paris from rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. once on board in euro business class it was all pamper. the meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and bbq style prawns. finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely spanish white. once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. so well down ba for what i know for others turned out to be a nightmare.,no
no,ba seem to be trying harder ground customer service much more friendly professional and efficient. t5 helps as it is a great terminal. flew premium economy lhr to denver flight sold out so got upgraded to prem economy. positives : small cabin between 1st class and business makes it very exclusive and quiet (747 config 1) with no through traffic of other passengers. upgraded service - welcome drink newspaper hot towel menu noise cancelling headphones upgraded blanket and much better food than economy (steak) bread selection etc. one flight attendant for the whole cabin but he was super efficient. flight attendant was excellent - friendly professional with none of the ba attitude that some have. toilet just for premium economy. negatives: 747 aircraft is old and you can feel that. inflight entertainment is ancient small screen limited selection in both video and music seat space and functionality good but not air nz. toilet hygiene remains ba achilles heel - they just don't keep them clean vs. asian airlines. this product is much improved from previous times i have taken it.,no
no,madrid-london city return. excellent experience. flights on time in fact 25 minutes early into lcy and arrival and departure procedures at both mad and lcy fast and efficient. the velazquez lounge at mad t4 is extremely comfortable and well-appointed with a good range of food and drink. flight on a newish embraer aircraft clean comfortable and spacious. outstanding service from the two friendly english and spanish speaking cabin crew. full english breakfast with champagne and orange juice on the outbound and a nice chicken dinner with good wines on the return.,yes
no,our flight on economy long distance from the austin to heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. the seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. we had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. the evening meal we were served was inedible. the pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. it was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. the foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. as for the breakfast in a box it was so bad i cannot comment. we've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on myanmar airlines! we want to support our national airline but definitely not on ba economy. it seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. a huge disappointment.,no
no,"ba 138 13/5/2015. ba 273 13/5/2015. just completed my first ba flight in club world. the experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". the flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". the crew was totally indifferent. the light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. if you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. the buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. will never travel ba again.",yes
no,lgw - antigua - lgw. easy check in at the club world desk and then quickly through security etc. unusually for ba at gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. we pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. i can't say the seats were the most comfortable i have ever sat on but the extra leg room in pe did help. two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. the food was just about ok although i never have any great expectations so i am rarely disappointed. however the size and picture quality of the tv screens was very poor and as a result i decided to read for most of the journey. the cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. the return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the club world desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. overall another good experience with ba bar the few issues that i have mentioned.,yes
no,"19 april kwi-lhr ba157. lhr-edi ba1454. 3 may edi-lhr ba1459. lhr-kwi ba156. kwi-lhr-edi-lhr-kwi: booked world traveller plus (premium economy) but upgraded to club world (business class) on the outward trip. an excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. on all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - i was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked a wide range of entertainment on the kwi-lhr sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because i flew out in april and back in may the selection had changed on the return flight). smooth flights (the 747's on the kwi-lhr sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - i really enjoy flying the ""queen of the skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. slight delay outbound at kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. i travelled on a sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at heathrow although i had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when i booked my ticket. all in all four excellent flights - ba seem to have improved immensely since i last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason i use ba in preference to the carriers from the middle east especially as terminal 5 at heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).",yes
no,ba108 dxb-lhr club world in seat 10g. very nice seat no bother from anyone stepping over you and also right next to the loo and cw kitchen so great access to snacks. also as i was at the front of the cabin i got off the plane nice and speedily. food was good had a nice vegetarian pasta main course. plus the afternoon tea i got offered plenty of scones as most people surprisingly didn't want them!,no
no,bru-lhr-yyz: club europe - club world; this time again check-in was smooth with friendly ground staff the best croissant in this lounge. boarding was easy friendly cabin crew was waiting for us to take jackets. hot towels tasting breakfast landed on time. this short flight 10/10. security in heathrow was horror but i prefer the horror of waiting than the horror of terror. first lounge was a breeze. boarding for the flight to toronto was with busses driving us to the dreamliner. indeed the business seats are smaller. it really felt bad. the flight was not comfortable at all as i left the plane with pain in the back and shoulder. the crew were excellent the food was excellent and the screens are improved. but the space you have is really a shame. as a gold member i fly often business or first but the club world seats in the dreamliner are really smaller and not comfortable at all. i will avoid this plane in future. i am so happy i will fly back in a 777.,yes
no,lax-lhr-lax april return may 14. another chance to try the a380 product and all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at lax but once we boarded a self important flight attendant decided she had to check the boarding passes to ensure we were on the right plane on the right day. no you do not we have been checked all the way along. still even this pitiful attitude could not dampen the sterling job done by the pair of flight attendants we had. they gave mixed fleet a very good name. now having got through everything needed on that trip we had the return. wtp so the food was ok the thing is during the trip the lax sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. disaster. the staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue i guess eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed. so too were snacks of crisps etc. half way through a long flight? ba claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. clearly they are telling lies. this poor creature shut things because she had counted everything. anyway if ba wish to lie to us we will not be buying from their high life shop. it cuts both ways. so to sum up most ba staff really do try to make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience; certainly i have always flown ba where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in such a negative manner i shall not be rushing to fly them again. closing the bar and snacks after less than six hours on a flight of over eleven hours? to fly to be self serving.! i really can no longer recommend ba.,yes
no,outward from heathrow 8th may ba543 to bologna. return 10th may ba545. flew return lhr to bol. it is a long time since i have flown with ba and i was reminded just how good they are. i really cannot fault any aspect of the journey from the check in staff to the cabin crew and seat comfort. every aspect was highly professional. i was impressed with terminal 5 and think it creates an excellent first impression of britain.,yes
no,lhr to cpt in first (777 aircraft). concorde room as always quiet and private with excellent bar service (we did not try the restaurant) and wonderful views from the terrace (plenty of natural light). boarding by separate bridge. a warm welcome greeted by name and escorted to my seat by a smiling member of staff. offered a glass of champagne wash bag and night suit. departure and arrival on time. food and beverages very good (excellent bloody mary). bed was made by staff with extra mattress provided. very good level of comfort. entertainment of good standard (in generally i prefer to sleep). staff brilliant always smiling and discretely present to serve. small hiccup no hot breakfast in the morning (no explanation given). overall an excellent trip of very high standard with an impressive cabin crew.,yes
no,cpt-lhr-mad in club. check-in in cpt quick and efficient. lounge elegant with good choice of snacks and food and an excellent selection of south african wines. boarding was announced in the lounge. boarding a bit chaotic. seated in the first class section of this old 747. greeted by name and offered a glass of champagne by a charming member of staff. departure and arrival on time. food and beverages of high quality and standard. as i was traveling with my husband the table was set so that we could dine together by using the companion's ottoman. entertainment ok-the very small screen of the old first class. the bed was made by the staff using an extra mattress. a good nights sleep in a comfortable bed. cabin crew excellent always smiling and professional. lhr-mad in a refurbished 321. emergency exit seat with lots of space and comfort. excellent cabin crew delivering an outstanding service with hot or cold breakfast for a very busy club europe cabin. greeted personally by the purser due to my frequent flyer status. overall impression an excellent trip where a lot of attention to every detailed was paid. indeed to fly to serve.,yes
no,flew man-lhr-yyz and return. outward in premium economy on a 777 there was plenty of leg room and a good entertainment system food was nice and plenty of options for drinks. cabin crew good. flew back from yyz-lhr on 747 i was upgraded from premium economy to club world by the cabin crew which was excellent. comfortable seat plenty of options for food and drink. cabin crew attentive helpful and very friendly couldn't have asked for a better flight. everybody seems to have a go at ba i find them reasonable priced and excellent to fly with.,yes
no,lhr-eze business class on board b777. tired old cabin old ife system. business class seat layout cramped and uncomfortable with forward and rear facing seats. however cabin crew deserve praise for their excellent attention.,yes
no,flew ba on open-jaw route bru-lhr-lax returning one week later sfo-lhr-bru. bru-lhr was on an a319 newly refurbished plane. i paid for seating selection weeks before. the day before on-line check-in opened i saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so i took one of them to deplane as quick as possible (the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway). lhr-lax on the a380 was a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. food was not bad as long as you don't expect anything too fancy in economy. there was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. on an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but passengers are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! sfo-lhr still on the a380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation. same nice experience nice crew and so on. lhr-bru on an a320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at heathrow. once again the captain kept us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in brussels. overall really nice experience but i wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. as i may be a nervous flyer i need a window seat and don't want to risk seating elsewhere. the four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which i could take into account when choosing between ba and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight. besides that i won't hesitate to fly ba in the future.,yes
no,travelled lgw-mco-lgw route in business and was really happy. great check at check in at lgw then priority security access. the lounge was superb. seats on 777er outward were 2j and 2k which were fine but we changed to 11e and 11f for the return as we noticed that on outward these were more enclosed. flat beds were great service was exceptional. both flights left on time and arrived on time. delta lounge at mco is a bit dated but served a purpose so cant complain. was a bit worried about the service reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. well done ba.,yes
no,pisa-lgw. lounge at pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. spacious and colourful. comfortable seats. much better than hanging around the terminal. we have used it a few times. plenty of booze. mediocre snacks. no food. checked in online. baggage drop off. no problems. plane was parked on the tarmac. had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish i wasn't going home). this is very annoying - because the whole point over flying ba instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. this has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (more ba cuts i wonder) plane was a newish a319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. all clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed i happily drank three gin and t's. fa's very pleasant and friendly. even offered me a 4th g&t which i declined. all in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). landed ahead of schedule.,yes
no,i flew from heathrow to istanbul on ba on their 767 the crew in club europe were very accommodating in their service. from start to finish of the flight they ensured that all passengers in club europe received the upmost service. although the 767 is starting to show some age i prefer this version of the club europe seats compared to the new configuration which is being rolled out on their airbuses. at least the seats on the 767 are comfortable & there is plenty of space between the rows compared the the new version which has the same pitch as economy. the catering was good with a great choice of meals to select from the service was speedy and accommodating too with their drinks etc..,yes
no,flew first from london to seattle checked in at t5 and escorted to check-in desk and was checked in very quickly security was quick and then through the million dollar door straight into the concorde room. had lunch in the lounge and think our host was just finishing her shift as not that attentive and service improved markedly when other staff took over after our starters. good selection of food and drinks and a very relaxing start to our flight. boarding smooth and both of us were escorted to our seats 2e/f which are 2 together in the middle of the cabin. cabin crew on both sides were excellent and couldn't do enough to make our flight comfortable. seat very good and food good quality with a wide selection of drinks available. flight passed very quickly and being first off plane meant we were first at us immigration although there was no queues so through within 5 minutes and our bags were first off. excellent flight.,yes
no,flight ba 677 istanbul to london heathrow club europe a great flight with a wonderful crew in club europe excellent service from all members of the crew with updates and a warm welcome by name from them. the meal was very good indeed with a great choice of meals to choose from. throughout the flight the crew were very professional and quick to serve the meal and to clear away the meal items too. although a 767 which was showing some signs of age i much prefer this aircraft with the old style club europe seats compared to the new club europe which has been rolled out by ba and which no one likes. a wonderful flight and great service what more could i ask from a great crew all that i do ask is keep the 767 & go back to the old club europe.,yes
no,manchester to jfk via heathrow and back. positive experience although the flight from manchester to heathrow was delayed (outside ba control) we were constantly informed about the delays. attention to detail was excellent. ba upgraded our flights at our request promptly and without any fuss (silver wedding anniversary). the flight attendants were excellent and the food (and drinks) was tasty. some passengers can be somewhat critical about ba but we were more then satisfied with the service.,yes
no,travelled from gatwick to barbados on boeing 777. seating very good. as many reviewers mention the screen is small with a limited amount of films. overall staff very good although one member of staff forget to give bread rolls out with the dinner until asked. the same member of staff also forgot requested drinks. very good boarding procedure and disembarkment overall a pleasant flight.,yes
no,a short hop from lcy-zrh. nice clean embraer which was only about 30% full on a monday afternoon. off on time landed early decent pasta salad meal and a white wine in flight. smooth and efficient journey at a very good price.,yes
no,sat-dfw-lhr-bru: first first club europe. sat-dfw: nice and smooth check-in with friendly ground crew no lounge but used my priority pass to enter united lounge. plane delayed for one hour. boarding smooth greeted by friendly cabin crew captain apologised for the delay. offered hot towels and champagne and crisps or nuts. short but nice flight. landed with a small delay. dfw-lhr: first class lounge in dfw is very basic and far from boarding gate. boarding again was very smooth with waiting flight crew greeting you by name and guiding to your seat. champagne was offered before you could take place in your seat. this first class travel was again a more than excellent flight. also this time there was a technical issue but the captain informed us about every step excused several times for the delay again when landing in london with a delay of more than an hour. cabin crew gives you the feeling you are the only guest on board giving you private service on demand. lhr-bru: club europe. concorde room with online reserved cabana and a tasteful breakfast. private bathroom with shower gave me a new revival boost. boarding yes again excellent in all ways short flight. hot towels decent food and perfect service by a perfect crew.,yes
no,bru-lhr-dfw-sat. bru-lhr: club europe smooth check-in with friendly ground crew small but clean lounge with a delicious croissant and coffee greeted by friendly cabin-crew who gave us an excellent service on this small flight starting with hot towels tasting hot breakfast and excellent tea seats are comfortable but narrow for this short flight. lhr-dfw: first class with fast security process concorde room with online reserved cabana was again an island of rest and comfort. clean 777-300 greeted by name flight crew were excellent. flight and service couldn't be better. food was good amenity kit contains everything you need on a 10-hours flight slippers and pyjamas were comfortable. service was private excellent and on request always with a smile asking if everything was alright. screen in first is still on of the best with a good selection of movies. dfw-sat: first class customs in dallas were electronic for esta people so 10 minutes after leaving the plane i was waiting for my bags so i could recheck for my last domestic flight! greeted by friendly crew when boarding old plane aa. we were offered hot towel and glass of champagne. friendly captain told us after leaving the gate that there was a problem and we did have to taxi to another gate for technical support. after 1 hour (captain had kept us informed) we took off an arrived after a short flight in san antonio.,no
no,this was the first time i have flown with ba and i have to say i was very impressed. i flew economy from brisbane to lhr return. via singapore on the outgoing trip and hong kong on the return leg. the experience was so much better than on previous flights i had taken with competing airlines. the cabin felt spacious and comfortable even in economy. there was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful. the cost of the flight was a little more expensive than other airlines but having been very satisfied with the service it would not preclude me from booking with them again. would preference them over other airlines now following that trip along with recommending them to others.,yes
no,ist-lhr the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. having flown on turkish royal jordanian emirates and cathay pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. never again!,yes
no,"lgw-pisa. i wrote a positive experience a few weeks ago - on the lhr route to pisa. i am pleased to write (wait for it) another positive review. this time it was the ""old"" club europe and better in my view. as i said before its a shame ba cannot produce something exceptional rather than ""very good"" when it comes to the seat. the lounge was okay - not to crowded. flight left 10 minutes late. very nice meal on board. really tasty and fresh. nice smoked salmon and so on. a few gin and t's washed it down. friendly fa's. smooth flight. my only gripe we were parked off station on the outer airport - like ryanair. a small hassle with a walk over the tarmac. bags were not given priority which was annoying. all in all - a good experience.",yes
no,excellent experience lhr to hkg. was a bit apprehensive about their reputation but found the whole trip excellent. staff were friendly and helpful aircraft was clean and ife gave a wide choice. drinks offered half an hour into the flight and meal served within an hour. would definitely travel with ba again.,no
no,we flew premium economy class from singapore to london on a 747 carrier. it was a waste of money. the plane looked 100 years old and nothing seemed to work properly. the entertainment system remote control was stuck to its base and it had to be removed with a sharp instrument. the little screen showed a blurred picture so it was not worth watching movies. the crew was nowhere to be seen and they couldn''t be called if you needed something because the call button had been cancelled on all remote controls. at some stage i went to the toilet and went through the kitchen. the crew was there talking and laughing and one of them was sitting reading the paper. shame on you ba. never again!,yes
no,lhr-syd-lhr via singapore. i hadn't flown ba long-haul for over fifteen years and so given some of the rather negative reviews on this site i approached the experience with trepidation. however i needn't have worried: everything was tip-top from on-line check-in bag drop lounges boarding on-time departure and arrival on both legs and prompt luggage collect. the aircraft both ways was a newish 777-300er clean and well maintained and while the herring-bone seat configuration does seem a bit weird on both sectors i was in the last row window seat facing backwards with an empty seat next to me so i was able to slip in and out easily enough and didn't have anyone facing me. the seat was a little narrow for business class. but very comfortable with lots of storage space and no shortage of pillows and blankets; the ife was excellent - screen on the small side but very good definition and audio. food was simple but very good quality fresh well-presented and lots of it. very generous with the booze - excellent champagne wines and some fine malt whiskies all served correctly by the wonderfully attentive fas: old school british middle aged ladies and gentlemen chatty and polite to the point of parody but the twinkle in their eyes tells you that they know it. an excellent experience keep it up ba.,yes
no,lhr-mad with ba462 on a boeing 767-300er. very full flight but it didn't stop the crew from delivering superb customer service! drinks and sandwich offered 30 minutes after take off. second round of drinks offered. very cheerful crew helpful and friendly. pilot personally came out to greet passengers on our way out. very smooth take off. landing could be better. would definitely fly with british airways again!,yes
no,for my annual trip ath-phl via any european city (dep 18/3 return 19/4) this time i chose ba because they were the cheapest. this was my first flight on ba to the usa. soon after my choice i tried to select a seat as far front as possible however i was asked to pay 35 euros for a seat in row. 27. 35 euros and you are almost at the end of the aircraft. in the end ba was more expensive than others. the flight was ok and punctual b777 not really my choice as very noisy staff service - one hostess was excellent another was ignorant and unwilling. food the usual penne rigate. complained to ba via email however no reply was ever received. for my return flight i was in row 30 same noisy b777 same penne rigate and of course a good choice of inflight entertainment. breakfast with lovely frozen bread roll. yes frozen or chilled. my next choice will of course not be ba.,no
no,a short haul from gatwick to rome and i had no expectations. check in was quick and we were on a vintage boeing 737. all in all very happy. they supplied a decent enough snack. drinks service was efficient. there was no in- flight entertainment available but we should all be able to cope for 2 hours without surely? comfortable enough friendly service got there on time and good price. all adds up to a happy traveller.,yes
no,ncl-lhr return. great alternative to rail travel which is sometimes more expensive. check-in was a breeze on both sides. new comfortable a320 cabin old ones were really aged. a choice of snack and drink were served with options for alcohol. delay arriving into heathrow as usual the airport is really over capacity and limiting ba as an airline. annoyed that you are no longer able to choose your seat on hand-baggage only fares!,yes
no,flew from london heathrow to rome fiumicino. flew the same route last year too and both times it was excellent. this time our flight was operated with an airbus a320 with slim line seats that looked brand new. these were very comfortable for a short haul flight and the leg room sufficient. in-flight catering was excellent. coffee was a bit weak but the sandwiches were delicious. this time cheese and ham doorstop with white bread. i expected good things after last years flat bread and was not disappointed. cabin crew were very friendly and efficient as were the airport staff. boarding process was fast and efficient and on both flights at arrival and destination the aircraft was at a jet bridge so no need to board a bus. flights departed and arrived on time. will definitely fly ba again.,yes
no,lhr-sfo-lhr. missed out on the a380 and both legs were in a 747-400. planes were old but well maintained and clean so no complaints there. outward leg was excellent with good food and great cabin service. on the return leg the lady in front fully reclined her seat immediately after take off and went to sleep leaving me with just about the same cramped space as you have in economy. even during meal service cabin crew did nothing to alleviate the situation. very disappointed with this aspect and also with the breakfast. how many people on this site have complained that they do not want a hard croissant and sweet cereal bar for breakfast. ba are you listening?,yes
no,heathrow to bilbao. this is one of ba's new routes (although they used to fly the route years ago on a b757) and we got our return flights for a bargain â£74. ba's hand luggage only fares to europe offer very good value and i wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! the a319 flight left from heathrow terminal 1 which is closing in june but now looks and feels like a ghost town. there were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. as for the flight we had the usual ba chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to ryanair with hardly any space. i appreciate ba's offering of sandwiches on their short haul flights but do wonder whether passengers really need this service nowadays.,yes
no,club europe lhr-ams. the boarding process was a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft. in the boarding lounge they asked for all club europe and gold and silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passengers board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke. they should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by club europe passengers at least when departing club europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding. i understand there is a need for on time departures but ba really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their club passenger receive it.,yes
no,"ba 1321 newcastle to heathrow 1/4/15. check in at newcastle was as always very fast and efficient. once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone. a great crew offering old school ba charm at it's best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time. new and very ""compact"" seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul european flights. flight arrived at t5 not quite on time as i remember but hey ho not at all bad.",no
no,flew gatwick to kingston 13/3/15 return 27/3/15 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together ba did not even try to accommodate us. not worth the money virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. will never travel ba long haul again be warned don't waste your money.,no
no,ba1326 heathrow to newcastle 22/4/15. checked in at t5 by an agent who should train some of the others. very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. the good experience ended there. punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. i've recorded this repeatedly. departure was delayed 45 minutes. not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly i can pretty much count on it. it's a shame ba can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. once on board ba is like a tale of two airlines. some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. but whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. when we landed at newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! well marvellous not in my opinion. having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule i have to say that i remain generally unimpressed.,no
no,hong kong to london in world. it was on the a380 - first time aboard and must say i was impressed. a much better experience than the emirates a380. great mood lighting large windows. nice to have a number of small cabins on both decks. friendly service from the crew.,yes
no,ba 730 lhr-gva 20 apr 15. are fooling no-one with their new club europe business class seats - they look nice - but are too close together providing extremely poor legroom! as a regular london to geneva traveller i will go back to flying swiss! the decision to change this is almost as bad as the stupid decision to have seats facing backwards in club world where you have to face strangers and climb over others to get to your seat. if you can't fly first class with ba choose another airline until they remedy these issues because their business class product is rubbish!,yes
no,april 3 2015 sydney-lhr. staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. the cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. ife was fine although not as good as cx. i was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. the seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. there is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. the problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. it is so narrow that you cannot turn. the seat buckles in the middle. as well the passenger next to me would slam his table and tv monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. to get comfortable i had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. as well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. ba are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for cx). they are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. it is time for them to deliver an update. the only reason i took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which i needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that i was flying back in first for no additional cost which i will post about separately. so while i recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. next time i fly business it will be cx again. the seat is a real let down.,no
no,15th aug 2014 flight ba0272. me and my 3 friends flew from san to lhr then to ist. our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. i wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. when they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. they could not even manage to sit us together. when i was thinking how could this get worse we missed our lhr-ist flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. while a clerk was trying to complete our check-in for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane.,yes
no,april 15 lhr-sydney (via singapore). i flew first as part of a promotion for no additional cost with purchase of business seat on syd-lhr leg. i really enjoyed the concorde room at terminal 5 lovely meal great service and very elegant space. in terms of the flight the fa were very friendly and helpful on all legs. they went out of their way to make you feel special and a guest. food was very good as was wine offering. seat was comfortable and roomy although there is a lot less storage then in cx business seat. in fact while there is a lot of room much of it really is not that useful. at night fa did disappear for much of the time and didn't really come around (except once) to offer water/juice. whereas on sq economy fa would check on you regularly throughout flight. while of course it is very special to fly first next time i would be just as happy to fly cx business which i think is really great value for money and the seats are just as or maybe even more comfortable. if i had paid full fare for this flight i think i would have been questioning the value for money.,yes
no,ba662 31st march. ba662 14th april. ba makes us think 'better quality'. however the flight to and from cyprus is now disappointing in terms of food offered. the duration is over 4 hours and it is not acceptable for them to offer 2 cold sandwiches.,no
no,ba0010 world traveller 4 apr 2015. bangkok-heathrow (london). ba0009 world traveller 17 apr 2015 heathrow (london) - bangkok. the check in staff were unhelpful and refused to check my luggage through despite it being done on the first leg of my trip i also met others on the same flight where this was allowed. the plane was old. the cabin crew were professional however compared to the middle eastern airlines the service wasnt nearly as good.,no
no,lhr-bkk in club on b777. fourth long haul leg on ba in the last month and this was by far the best flight. that said i still think the product is disappointing. i'm the camp that says the seats are highly uncomfortable. they are far too narrow as an average sized person still finds their arms draped across the arm rests while trying to sleep. you simply can't keep your arms by your side. as such little to no sleep. ife outdated and awful.,no
no,lhr-ams-lhr in club europe on a321. nice service for a short hop. i think ba's club europe product is better than their long haul product. no flat beds but aircraft were in good condition cabin crews professional efficient and genuinely nice. food was actually edible with a cheese and charcuterie plate. both flights delayed due to heathrow congestion and amsterdam weather but other than that a pretty good experience.,no
no,"lhr-phl ba067 19th april. one of the features of a british airways (ba) flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. this until recently included a ""seafood meal"". indeed ten years ago ba had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the british fishing industry - no longer. seafood meals are gone. why? from a ba response: ""i'd like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options"". indeed. if no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. there is only chicken-or-pasta. really what would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll? one more reason to choose ba is gone. one more reason to fly with a middle eastern airline such as etihad who still care about service of a sort that ba has started to abandon.",no
no,flew ba1385/175 man-jfk. first flight full but smooth second flight on old but clean 747 with good leg room. wifi and food good. was just thinking as we were landing early what a good flight it had been when landing was aborted abruptly and we circled again eventually the captain said that two warning lights had gone off but the problem appeared to be rectified his manner remained calm and the plane landed safely me and several around me were obviously very anxious.,yes
no,gatwick to thessaloniki return. outbound ok not fantastic but certainly not bad. however where ba scored was on the return. at check-in the clerk was all prepared for my wife and i even though we were on separate bookings including ready printed lounge passes with my guest pass stapled to her own. maybe a little thing but it made a difference.,no
no,17 april 2015 airbus a320 business heathrow to lisbon. a total waste of money. the food was horrible. a couple of sandwiches and a lousy bread served with jam. there was no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from economy was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. the seat pitch was pathetic and could not even get a rest. i am very disappointed that i did not choose tap instead of british.,yes
no,lhr to syd on 1/3/15 and ack to lhr on 14/3/15. after some poor reviews i was a little worries as to the quality and whether premium economy would be worth the extra cost. i have previously travelled down under with cathay and malaysian and wondered how ba would measure up. i was pleasantly surprised. cabin on both planes was clean staff mostly attentive (hong kong leg to heathrow staff were worst of the 4 legs - ok but didn't seem overly interested in going the extra mile). as a taller person i appreciated the additional legroom and recline although when passenger in front reclined it is tricky to get out of your seat. i had veggie meals which were generally tasty and as usual served prior to everyone else - i did have to remind staff on the last leg to offer me a drink when they served everyone else's meal. film selection was excellent - travelling shortly after oscar season meant most of the big nominated films were available! i will definitely pay for pe again on long-haul.,no
no,my experience on return ba flights to lhr to tokyo narita in april 2015 scores very low. i used to fly on virgin atlantic for the same journey on business class for the past 10 years so i have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the business class on virgin was my impression. ba t5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. selection of food and beverages is limited. in the end i got fed up so i left the lounge to get better food from wetherspoons! since i'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. on ba you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! also if you are in the middle aisle on ba you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. ba gives out elemis kits. food: on ba there is a 'fixed' options. for the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. not both. also not too different a menu from economy class. ba's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. ba disappointed me.,yes
no,my return flight from heathrow to bologna last week reminded me of how good ba is for short haul in economy. even a two-hour delay because of technical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. the pilot kept us up to date on what was happening. the crew were charming. ok the snack of a sandwich on such flights is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airlines.,yes
no,del-lhr ba 256. seats 17ab downstairs in business class in b747-400 g-bnly. the aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. i have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. i have made several long haul flights with ba in business class recently and have decided that i don't like the standard ba model business class seat. there is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. there is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. there is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. at the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. it is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. clunky and peculiar to ba it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. thoughts about coffins come to mind. when the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. seat 17b was a poor choice. it is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. on the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.,yes
no,"10 april 2015 airbus a320 business heathrow to rome fco. a total waste of money. the food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference i could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. as alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.",yes
no,flew ba256 from delhi to heathrow - usual ba issues which have been repeated here many times. firstly the first cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! the food - the food can only be described as truly awful! to be honest i would be complaining if i received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. i did not bother with desert! afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie i have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. the cabin crew were good and pleasant however i was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. it would seem to me that ba are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but i am struggling to see any level of improvement (i take at least 1 first class international flight every year). have flown ba for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. the lounge (not run by ba but used by ba) at delhi was very good indeed.,no
no,9 april 2015 ba 777 business class seattle usa - heathrow. check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. flat bed seats were comfortable enough. the breakfast was a little skimpy. the major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. ba will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,no
no,we flew for the very first time on ba on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. our holiday to st lucia from gatwick was booked through kuoni and we usually fly with virgin atlantic. we always upgrade with virgin to premium economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the premium economy experience with virgin is very good. therefore we booked ba world traveller plus expecting the same degree of service. what a disappointment! i would not advise wasting your upgrade money. apart from getting the larger luggage allowance ba world traveller plus is almost exactly the same as world traveller. the service both ways was appalling! the seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 hour flight! we had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with business class customers and had no time for our section at all. on the way back my husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. we only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. on this length of flight i was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and were asleep throughout the 9 hours. the seat back tvs are very small and my tv didn't work properly and i couldn't even watch anything. the aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. we will never fly with ba again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.,no
no,substandard food in business class (london to mauritius) arbitrary upgrade policy - as we could not afford bus class on return flight booked premium economy we told that because we were bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. charging for seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out!,no
no,while i booked with ba i at first did not realise that they were putting me on a vueling airline but flying under a ba number. quite clearly this airline is at the bottom of the bucket airlines in both service and comfort. as we were flying back from barcelona to the uk having my knees wedged up against the seat in front only lasted a couple of hours. the food service which you had to pay for was indifferent and very expensive. if you sat in the middle of the plane you just didn't get served. probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor english by cabin and flight crew was the cabin staff apparent indifference to seats being up right for landing preventing some passengers taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passengers up and around while the aircraft was moving. perhaps uk bucket airlines are not so bad.,no
no,ba 208 mia-lhr in club. leg four of a seven leg ba adventure. another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. as in leg one bkk-lhr my pre-assigned business class seat that i had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. in the end ba needed the seat for a family to be seated together. all well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. as such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. as a loyal oneworld emerald passenger i can honestly say ba really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. the csd was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. that hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on ba. moral of the story: never ever pay ba for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than ba.,yes
no,british airways could not care less when they knew our flight from leeds to heathrow had been diverted. some queued two hours for another flight with two children only to be told we had to go to heathrow by coach with no toilet. we had nothing to eat at the airport as no one knew what was happening. we finally got to heathrow to be put up in a hotel and have a meal so we could fly to miami the next day. it was a total farce at leeds we lost a days holiday and with two children there was no consideration for them at all. we await our homeward journey on monday and hopefully it will be a better trip back.,no
no,travelled by airbus 319 to lyon and back to heathrow. the new layout is very cramped. by reducing the legroom in club europe and removing one of the toilets at the rear they have crammed in 11 more seats. seats 25a and b have no window as they are placed where the toilet used to be. they are adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet. not very pleasant. expect long queues to use this one remaining lavatory. they also seem to have done away with the cooked breakfast on all european flights that start before 9.30am.,yes
no,lgw to las had a great trip out on 2/4/15 good food ife was fine for the daytime trip wine was flowing. trip made even better by an upgrade to pe on return journey staff found out my partner and i got engaged couldn't have been nicer. everything great apart from the final leg to dub gatwick didn't send our bags (even though we had a 6 hour layover) then preceded to keep us hanging in dub for another 5 hours on the promise that they were on the next flight and the next ground staff of aer lingus were great too would fly all again.,yes
no,lhr-fra in club europe. first part is not really a review more a rant. i travel a lot for work and always try to fly ba whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a gold card so for our annual vacation i was looking forward to hopefully getting us all (wife plus 9 year old daughter) into the first class lounge at lhr as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no. - yes i know you can only normally sign in 1 guest but for my other 50+ flights a year i never sign in anyone! still no joy-computer said no. so i asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'. we walked away having been made to feel like naughty kids. rest of the trip was fine-in fact i would go as far as to say the flight was excellent-really friendly cabin crew who made us feel welcome and gave us a good start to the holidays. actually i would say this was ba at its best (having just seen them at their worst!). score given here reflect the good service in the air (would give almost full marks if not for the ground staff behaviour).,no
no,travelled man-lhr-atl and back. boarding at man chaotic with queue in a corridor (probably not ba's fault). delayed departure from lhr on a very full 777-200. food and wine good but the club world cabin is very cramped with very little space to put anything. i don't mind the back and front seating (i could look at my wife!) but the seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping. very good attentive crew. wide variety of films/music on ife. on return the third party lounge (club at atl) is much better than the delta one. full flight very similar to outbound but slightly early arrival at lhr was negated by the domestic flight being delayed by 90 minutes due to runway problems.,no
no,"ba0676 ist-lhr boeing 767. euro traveller cabin. read the reviews and we pre booked exit row seats 27a/b excellent choices. leg room superb i'm 1.90m (6'3"") tall and could stretch right out with a window too. still an old 767 though with no personal entertainment or power. appeared to have the newer seats which were ok surprisingly the four hour flight passed quite quickly. food was actually very good and the crew superb. disappointing choice of alcohol though no jd or rum. departed ist about twenty minutes late but were only ten minutes late into lhr. well done ba better than the outward experience reviewed earlier.",no
no,lgw-szg in business class. not sure what the point is with the new reduced legroom club europe seats. ok breakfast but was able to get breakfast in the lounge beforehand anyway. only reason for going ce was because only £30 more than flexible economy ticket. if there was a big difference i wouldn't bother. flight was on time.,yes
no,flew to bangkok from london heathrow on 13th march. first time i have ever flown with ba normally fly long haul with virgin but they don't fly to bangkok. we were offered upgrades in the last few days for big discount but only on the flight out. world traveller plus was very good with fab leg room and comfy seats. nice food too. managed to sleep 5 hours in quiet cabin. but if i had paid normal price then it was not worth the extra money as we found economy seats on the flight home were very comfy and good leg room. the plane was older 777 but not problem. very clean and the staff were attentive. i was nervous because of previous reviews but no need to be as we had a very enjoyable flight.,yes
no,lhr-jfk/iad-lhr. superb round trip (for a very fair price) in economy with ba. flight out was an hour or so late taking off because of the weather but was excellent once we got going. fairly creaky 747 but the ife was fine (good film selection) and the free booze flowed throughout. great curry on the food front. return was the real highlight on a new a380 that had joined the fleet four weeks ago. large tvs even bigger selection of films/tv shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and i'm over six foot). service on both flights exemplary and i have to say that i think ba have become a really class act.,yes
no,flew 30th march 2015 lhr-yvr return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. enjoyed it. but the ife was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of british airways- outdated movies with tv shows from 3 months before. since we were flying on a boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. one recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! even though there were negatives flying outbound i have to say the return was great. i had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so i sat in the extra legroom seats. ife was far better and due to having the window seat i was able to sleep for around 6 hours when i was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. food had no flavour and was quite spicy (lentil masala) but still edible. although my experience on ba84 was very enjoyable i heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working ife. one of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. he had flown with cathay pacific to manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. one of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. to improve british airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like singapore emirates etihad cathay pacific and qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from ba.,yes
no,heathrow to istanbul flight ba0676 in club class. i should have guessed what i was going to get when i saw this service is operated on a boeing 767. business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. no extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. food was only average too in my opinion. on the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 ba has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.,yes
no,lhr to philadelphia but return from jfk. booked club world and upgraded to first with avios. great service as always in first and the concorde room continues to excel.,yes
no,from shanghai to london on 17 mar. the whole trip was very good. the check in procedure was very quick. boarding was finished very quickly. the cabin staff were helpful and friendly. the cabin was very quiet. the temperature was very appropriate. i did enjoy the flight. meal was tasty drinks were quite good .luggage was not lost. i really can not expect more.,no
no,flew warsaw to heathrow. reasonable all round. fairly nice sandwich and drinks. crew were patient with some passengers who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. very busy flight. new seats are extremely cramped. feels a bit ryanair. boarding a bit chaotic as didn't do by seat row. baggage started coming off one carousel at heathrow only to inexplicably move to a different one without warning or announcement.,yes
no,i travelled from london to jo'burg and back on the airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. on the way out i was in premium economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. the return in business was a different matter. i was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. all this at a premium price. shocking. the cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! never again.,yes
no,return lhr-yvr boeing 747-400. i had been advised to fly ba but unfortunately i ended up very disappointed with the return leg. my seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working! when i asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. no other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. definitely would not fly with them again.,no
no,i usually have very positive experiences when flying ba. this time travelling on 30/03/15 lca-lgw the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. it was a 4.5 hour flight and were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to do for the next 4 hours. there was no inflight entertainment. the staff did not offer any hot drinks and when i walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if i wanted one i could go and get it from service area. the staff couldn't have looked any more disinterested in their passengers!,yes
no,lgw-jer-lgw day trip on march 25 both flights in economy morning flight on airbus 319 evening flight back on a 737-400 still featuring the more comfortable old seats. both flights on-time or early. excellent service for this short domestic hop. a breakfast sandwich and drinks were served in the morning while crisps or biscuits and full bar service were offered on the evening flight back. fas were excellent on both legs providing a good efficient and friendly service on these short flights. flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for both legs which worked efficiently. boarding procedures were unremarkable which is good. bas terraces lounge in lgw is fairly comfortable and spacious enough although very busy in the morning. acceptable cold breakfast choices and porridge as the only hot alternative. drink choices were plentiful and of good quality. bas terraces lounge in jer was more basic but again comfortable. again various good quality drink alternatives but just very limited food options (basic snacks such as crisps and hot soup). overall an excellent domestic flight experience for economy. would be more than happy to do it again. (oneworld sapphire).,yes
no,booked a trip via american airlines and my flight from london to seattle was on ba. what a treat. i wish all my aa trips were done by ba. great service leg space beautiful gates airplanes. the 8.5 hr trip went by quickly. tv in every seat with plenty of great choices. food was good and flight attendants were helpful and patient.,yes
no,london heathrow to dubai return. this is a fairly regular trip for leisure purposes. bought a pe ticket and used avios to upgrade as is my usual habit. prefer overnight flights but these recent ones were daylight. to be honest i only really choose biz for the space and flatbed. i do always find the food to be good though. it was a 747 going and a 777 coming back. i find the ba service to only be average and functional. i was 'missed' for several things and gave up trying to find anyone for a cup of tea. other airlines give a better service and provide a better product but so long as i upgrade with points and i can get a window seat i shall stick with it.,no
no,vie-lhr on march 24 and return lhr-vie on march 30 both straight forward point to point midday flights both flights in economy on an airbus a320 with a mixed fleet crew both legs on-time or early.– an edible sandwich and drinks (full bar) were served on both legs. on the flight to london fas were not unpleasant but not overly active except for the required meal service and duty free sales. however additional drinks were handed out in the galley if requested. on the flight back a rather young crew was trying harder but was - quite untypically for ba - rather robotic in their actions and announcements. again additional drinks were served if requested. both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. i am really missing the older more comfortable ba seats. flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for the first flight and the check in kiosk for the flight back. both worked efficiently. boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. ba uses a shared lounge in vie which again was quite busy but not overcrowded. the lounge as such is acceptable but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. food and drink seem to be more or less the same in all lounges in vie including os flagship lounge. ba’s galleries lounge in lhr t3 again a comfortable oasis of rest amid a busy airport. however this time (breakfast time) the food offerings were quite basic and drink wise even basics such as orange juice or tomato juice were not available. hopefully just an off day. ba still uses t3 for its flights to vie which i consider a huge benefit over using t5 which looks nice but tends to be a mess for passengers. overall a good flight experience although i have had much better crews on ba before. still consider ba as one of the best options for economy flights in europe. (oneworld sapphire).,yes
no,"very disappointing experience. arrived at airport for a flight to nice and learnt it was 1.5 hours late - with arriving aircraft nowhere in sight. prior flight was boarding (also delayed) having no luggage checked and seats available i thought i might get to nice after all in time. no such luck. whilst the flight continued to board for another 15 minutes i spent arguing with ba staff to even check whether they could get me on the flight. first class lounge staff refused to call the gate. all with ""flight is finalized"". in similar situations with other airlines (most notably lufthansa) they always re-opened the flight and got me on. the only excuse was ""it's the rules"" (obviously ba). staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the process. if i have a choice i will definitely use other airlines. in addition they have changed the seating in europe to come more in line with easyjet and ryanair. at 6""4 very uncomfortable. doesn't help to upgrade to business: same seat. so you end up paying 300 pounds for a very predictable and unexciting food.",yes
no,flew lhr-iad-lhr on new a380's in new world traveller plus. overall great service and experience with hard working and friendly crews both ways. new wtp product is great. seats are a huge improvement although 6 hours really is the limit on the overnight leg coming home for comfort. food was good including my partners vegan meal. new ife excellent and really like the upgraded noise cancelling headphones. only 'extra' i would have liked would have been the option of a sparkling water or even wine as a pre take off drink. have had the best and worst of ba over the years but this was definitely ba as it should be.,yes
no,lhr-del rtn. b747 both ways and definitely showing their age. crew were excellent both ways. people may not like the yin/yang seating arrangement but it doesn't bother me. the screen goes up after takeoff and you are in your own space. seat is still very comfortable. wine list also good and especially the rose offer alongside the champagne.,no
no,bru-ewr via lhr and jfk-bru via lhr on the return. all flights more or less on schedule. terminal 5 in lhr is nice with a lot of sunlight making it very bright and airy looking. cabin crew on all flights in general professional and giving a good service. food and drinks ok. the seats are however very small and ba really needs to update their seating as soon as possible. the first flight from brussels to london heathrow had their updated european cabin which offers better seats but a bit less legroom. seating on the b747 is very old but still a bit more comfortable then the new b787 dreamliner where the seats in economy are really too small and legroom just ok.,yes
no,23/3/2015 lhr-sin ba011 first. awful from booking to completion of the flight. as a ba. gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new a380 only to be told by ba in may 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to i wonder why ba squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. at the beginning of march i checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. i called the ba gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight i found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. i can only assume that rank has its privileges. now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the pa being inaudible i felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned i was ignored. i booked this flight for us a part of a special far east holiday i had high expectations of ba first which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. will now try to avoid flying ba in any of there classes once i have redeemed my avios balance.,no
no,lhr-phl return. first only half full on both legs as club not oversold. very much better service than when full as crew have time to interact. ba really should consider cutting back the number of seats and sell a truly premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement here. decent wines but whites/champagne always warm on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. t5 experience fine both ways as mid-week and time of year not so busy. lounges good and lounge staff friendly both lhr and phl.,yes
no,this was the last flight in a one world around the world ticket. buenos aries to lhr a 13 hour flight. i really didn't have any complaints about this flight or ba but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. the fa's were helpful the food was ok the only really bad thing was the avod. half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. likewise the album selection- pretty poor. the 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade. to be fare i'm comparing ba against emirates so no contest really!,no
no,london gatwick (lgw) to lanzarote (ace). we haven't flown ba for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with ba again anytime soon. the plane was an airbus 320 and was just like a bus. uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. we sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. we both came off the return flight with bad headaches. the food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. the service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. we flew the same route in october last year with a uk holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.,yes
no,del-lhr-ham in business. the club world product feels really old now. the seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. it was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to air india which has modern flat seats on the dreamliner. the food was ok but nothing special. the service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. amenity kits very cheap. the young indian crew members on the delhi route noticeably better than the older london based british crew. the plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. basically everything was mediocre if adequate. the overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. old planes old crew old seats old ife ba are losing ground not just to emirates but also other european carriers like lh or af. it feels like the 1970s and 1980s before ba transformed itself.,no
no,day to trip to hamburg booked the day before travel. great value for money. outbound flight was on refurbished a320. great new cabin comfortable seats - with enough legroom and great new lighting. on return was another a320 class - not refurbished. definitely will be good once all are refitted.,yes
no,i flew today from san francisco to heathrow business class and as always it's a delight flying with ba. staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. seats were comfortable. entertainment was ok and food was satisfactory. my only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. as i did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods i was left starving! i still find the overall experience with ba is far superior to any other airline.,yes
no,gru-lhr 15 march 2015. returned to ba this last 3 flights solely due to avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. bossy cabin crew in the like of ba as we remember its glory days. g&t always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! wine was good this flight. south america routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. outbound from lhr my tv didn't work but they did credit me 3000 avios. food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. klm and af do it better.,no
no,gva-lgw-gva a319 out and a320 in. on time in both directions staff were professional and polite. sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. smooth through geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at lgw on the way in (not ba's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. this was a rare occasion where ba was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. on balance i just don't think the ba experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to heathrow where terminal 5 is much nicer than gatwick. although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no british beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). i thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. on balance it was perfectly fine but i wouldn't pay the extra for ba - i'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyjet.,yes
no,"i have been a longstanding ba gold card holder and frequent business traveller. ba has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4"" i could not sit without great discomfort. this shows complete contempt for ba's customers. i first encountered this on a round trip to brussels. it will be eurostar for me in the future and air france for which i also gave a gold card on other short hauls. is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than easyjet offers?",yes
no,lhr-lax - a380 was excellent a breath of fresh air in comparison to the typical tired planes of ba. mixed fleet crew very friendly and enthusiastic. food onboard was excellent received my first choice and the club kitchen was stocked with a selection of delicious sweet and savoury snacks. the upper deck was excellent as it was very quiet and private with approx 20 seats in the forward section. entertainment very good on a larger screen than found on 747/777. cabin very clean and in general felt very fresh and new. the only gripe is still having to climb over the passenger seated in the aisle with the ying yang layout.,yes
no,we flew from lhr to brussels and back on a reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel! just about had time to enjoy the cream tea on the outbound flight. quality of the tea drink was the best i've tasted in the sky. the champagne was very nice too. business lounge at brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.,yes
no,"having heard so many negative reviews of ba i still mustered the courage to book to trip to chicago and sfo. to begin with when i reached mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure i was pleasantly surprised to see the ba staff ready to check in the baggage. we were thru checked in up to chicago with a 5 hour halt at lhr. london heathrow terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our chicago flight which was comfortable. our next connection from chicago to sfo on aa was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. then for our sfo-lhr-del flight the sfo-lhr got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. when we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! even after disembarking last of all we were met by the ba representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes. all went well except for one tiny hitch one piece of baggage never made it to our next flight.",yes
no,comfortable seats and plenty of space but the food was poor and the in-flight entertainment system was rubbish. the screens were small and the picture quality terrible. i liked that fact that the cabin crew were more mature people but the service was far from attentive. this is the first time i have flown with ba for over 15 years and i will try and avoid it in future. i have had much better flights with other airlines.,no
no,flew to and from punta cana from gatwick. two good flights. orderly check-in. great crew. food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. flights pretty much on time. both very busy. breakfast on arrival in london was poor too. ife is horrendously behind competitors. really dire. ran out of options after about half an hour. some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. the crew are the best part of ba as the seats and catering are not up to much. check in was excellent at both ends. there was a minor system glitch at punta cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. top notch.,no
no,we travelled cun-lgw 11 march and it's the last time we will ever travel business class with ba. no lounge facilities at cancun only a voucher offered for use in departure area food outlets. on board usual gymnastics to get in and out of seats ran out of food choices for dinner limited choice for breakfast tea served in a cup without saucer. cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. better value in cattle class.,yes
no,due to a health issue i chose to fly business class from sydney to singapore singapore to heathrow heathrow to mykonos and then returned ba15 6th october. i was seated in the same seat 16k both ways. my main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever i had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didn't have the meals that were on the menu. often i would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat. in the morning because i am diabetic i had to go to the front and ask for something to eat which was hard as most people where sleeping and i didn't want to disturb anyone.,no
no,yyz-dxb via lhr. outbound flight yyz-lhr was delayed by an hour. good thing they sent a text message well ahead of time. boarding was quick and efficient in flight entertainment (ife) was superb with plenty of very good choices latest releases. probably the best i've seen in economy class. service was ok normal. b777 was great - i'm 6ft 4in so i asked for bulkhead seats. i ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. lhr-dxb portion all good (b747). on the way back dxb-lhr was great (b777) - i took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other air carriers). lhr-yyz flew on the new dreamliner 787. i was not too impressed with the seat configuration and space. to me the 777 was more comfortable. all in all i was pleased with ba's service and comfort.,yes
no,travelled back from cape town on 28th february 2015. booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! complained to ba and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. what a total rip off! the seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing! ba need to get their act together and invest in better aircraft's. clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!,no
no,british airways business class is outclassed by rivals. the lay out of the seats needs sorting - i do not expect people to step over me when i have my seat extended in order to get out of their seating area. the inflight food was poor. drinks were offered occasionally - 3/4 times on a ten hour flight - slightly warm coffee - ran out of ice. the idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. inflight entertainment very poor. the terrace lounge at gatwick is outdated - no hot food apart from porridge (we checked in at 9.00am) a few pieces of cold toast plus the usual cold meats and cheese. booking business class with british airways is definitely not worth the money.,no
no,"i have to admit to not being a fan of the ba club world (business class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. on my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. on my flight from mle to lgw 10 hrs 35 minutes i was in 11b facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10b. the passenger in 10a facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. it is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in male and so after take off i was looking forward to a cold lager. the drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. the fa said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. i cannot drink warm lager and i am not a spirit drinker and so went without. i settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. no entertainment system and i then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. there were 2 meal services on the flight. the first one was ok but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at lgw all the economy bags came off first and the club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. i have been in correspondence with ba and customer relations has stated ""you traveled in the cabin you originally booked. however the meals we serve and our in-flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. the ba website has a description of this service which includes: 1) extensive flight entertainment system. 2) seat converts to 4 key positions. 3) choice of light meal or four course dining. ba claimed to be ""the worlds favorite airline"". they are not mine. they also clam ""to fly to serve"". well as they say they did fly me from mle to lgw bt i am not quite sure where the service came in.",yes
no,club europe from lhr to frankfurt rtn. outbound flight was great a320 with new seats which are very comfortable great food and a good service. aircraft on the return leg was a very old a319 rather dirty and quite shabby looking inside however purser working club europe was outstanding.,no
no,lhr-pisa-lhr. i have a house in tuscany so fly there often. i used to fly a certain yellow/blue/white budget carrier from stansted but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and that the fa's consistently spoke poor english. as a silver card holder my wife and i enjoyed a nice breakfast in the lounge. it was not busy. we were seated in the exit rows which i selected before we left. it was better than the club europe space i had last month - which is why i bought economy as opposed to club which i feel represents very poor value. the plane was a nice new a320 with the new seats. it was spotless. we had a nice snack on both flights + a few gin and tonics for me ! (the wife was driving on arrival) the fas were great. friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the pa system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. all in all ba at its best. they either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. there never appears to be anything in the middle. am flying again with them in 4 weeks time and look forward to it.,no
no,flew to bangkok with thai airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. we were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with ba. the leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic i couldn't see the tv screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as i have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. so uncomfortable. the food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice after a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. does ba actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time?,yes
no,my partner and i booked a long weekend break with ba in nyc including flights from manchester and accommodation - we deliberately selected the ba flight option for the round trip to save having to change terminals at london heathrow. when i booked us in online 24 hours before travel we discovered that our long haul flights had been changed to american airlines (5th to 9th march). this meant we had to change terminals t5 to t3 with very little time following our flight from manchester - even with the priority transfer notes it was a very close call and very stressful - not helped by the fact that we got held up trying to leave t5 due to a closed door! the flight with aa was ok but the food on both the outward and return legs was disgusting and not at all what we expected. the ba web site allowed me to book the arrival transfer but refused to allow me to book the return so i had to organise that myself! i have rated the travel experience questions 7 & 8 based on the american airlines flights to and from nyc. the ba flights from manchester to heathrow were great. we also struggled with the aa website when trying to check in for our return flights.,yes
no,lgw-tfs-lgw seat pitch and comfort were good. the snack was perfectly adequate but the bar service was diabolical. my husband asked for a beer which was bordering on warm. i asked for a bacardi and diet coke was advised had run out of bacardi (bearing in mind we were one of the first to be served). i settled for a white wine which was tepid had to add ice to it. further into the flight my husband asked for a second beer he was told that they had to save the beers for the return flight. our crew were all slightly older they were obviously very experienced to the point of doing everything automatically but not actually listening to the passengers. on our return flight we received almost the same service only allowed one can of beer and no bacardi. very disappointing we wanted to relax and celebrate our anniversary with an inflight drink. the return crew were slightly more attentive but the good old ba customer service was missing.,no
no,first time in reduced leg room club europe. don't bother no different to economy both colleague and i sat with legs splayed jammed into seat in front. save your money fly in the back and spend considerable savings on a better hotel better holiday or whatever. good crew and food though.,no
no,lhr-sof-lhr seat 1a on an upgraded a320 in both directions check in at t5 quick and the galleries lounge was fine as always. departed on time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew not that much room really for business class appears to be getting less. return check in quick although security at sofia very slow and the lounge is not worth using!! flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal served by yet another nice crew landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time i reached it.,yes
no,"this is not reflective of ba in general only this particular flight. i flew lhr-abv on saturday 7th march. this was the friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. this is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. there after you barely saw them! duty free sped through the cabin faster than usian bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. i was part way through completing mine when i heard the ""cabin crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! the seat i was sat in had a broken ife screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! sadly the seat i then chose also had an ife issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. third time lucky and hussar! i must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. the food would have been good save what was on the main menu. it was a choice of chickpea tagine chicken and african stew. which region of africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. anyway i opted for the chicken. i must say i was supremely underwhelmed. it was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising.",no
no,ba085 lhr to yvr 10/03/15. narrow seats without much legroom food acceptable but nothing special. upgrade not an option due to restrictions of avios programme. overall not happy.,yes
no,london to budapest and back in club class. first leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. the return was terrible. ba do not pay for cub europe travellers to use fast track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. the lounge is mediocre at best. absolutely not worth paying for club. ba need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.,yes
no,i flew from lhr to sin; the aircraft was a boeing 747-400 which was tired and old. the ife had to be re-booted and the system was not yet up to date like on other ba aircraft. the seating cover on my club world seat kept coming off the aircraft seemed very tired. the food again was at a good standard and the crew were helpful. i always fly ba and i love the boeing 747 but unfortunately the 747 have to go at some point.,no
no,lhr-sof-lhr 27th feb/2nd mar seat a1 on an a320 in both directions check in at t5 quick used the ba galleries south lounge which was good as ever. boarding on time as was departure and arrival new business seats on both aircraft which were comfortable enough. food (breakfast) and crew on outbound very good bags waiting once through immigration in sofia. return check in quick although security check was so slow the lounge in sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities food or drinks passengers would be better of using the general airport facilities! departure was almost an hour late as was arrival due to weather at heathrow; otherwise crew were great as was the lunch served.,yes
no,i took a flight from gatwick to barcelona. although it had a ba flight number it was operated by vueling and that meant i couldn't use the ba lounge despite my silver executive club membership. i didn't choose vueling i was under the impression i had chosen ba and would get the ba perks just the same. there was no in flight entertainment (hence 1/5 - it should be 0 of course).,yes
no,"i travel world-wide mostly on business and in business class. i don't think i have ever had a flight with ba that wasn't without an issue. recently and not for the first time i checked in to find that club class had been over sold. so lets call it what it is.. greed it's a disgusting practice. the planes are usually dirty and if you get ""bumped"" down to economy the food is awful while the cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly you don't see them apart from meal time even when you use the call button where do they go and what and what are they doing?",no
no,my return flight from cape town to heathrow ba0042 30/1/15 was a miserable experience. my entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be re-set. (no one was available to do it). when it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat would not recline. it was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. no one seemed to care that i needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. being polite and patient did me no good. i have several questions. how often are the seats serviced? why is the entertainment system so unreliable? how often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping? customer services want me to chose ba in the future but as they ignored addressing these issues when i wrote to them i have too many doubts.,yes
no,british airways general onboard services in first are generally acceptable. however the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid first class passengers. ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their first class passengers are sorely lacking at ba (ex. lufthansa first class terminal and transfers at fra and others). even as a gold executive club top tier member there is nothing available - even when i call and request assistance on long-haul first flights (ex. lhr to hkg) that involve changes in planes between t3 and t5 at lhr. ba needs to wake up and examine the overall first product. the upgrades to the first cabin are also marginal. packing 14 narrow (even on new a380s) seats in first puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other oneworld carriers who have a true first product (ex. cathay has 8 true suites in first). wake up ba - your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of first product amenities including full ground support (especially upon special request) for paying first passengers.,yes
no,heathrow - mexico and cancun - gatwick in economy. entertainment fine food ok spacious seats nice crew and excellent landing. i shall fly again with ba.,no
no,we flew with ba on 6th february to goa - had three flights in all starting at manchester. on our outbound journey we were upgraded to premium economy which was fantastic! very comfortable food was much nicer. on our way back we were in economy. as a family of 4 we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. our youngest was awfully sick i think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. bless the steward who cleaned it up. however we were sat for 10 hours with the after effects! nothing anyone could have done however. staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined there's little room. the passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my tv screen - i had to keep moving them off. just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!,no
no,flew lhr-jfk-lhr in february and enjoyed excellent service on both sectors. i used avios points for these flights and had booked in world traveller plus. from the moment i boarded at lhr terminal 5. i was addressed by name throughout the flight. (i have a ba executive club silver card.) the cabin crew couldn't have been more friendly yet discreet. offered a glass of champagne extra wine and post dinner drinks. i was given a very warm welcome. on the return from jfk i was surprised and pleased to have been given an upgrade to club world in spite of travelling on a reward flight. this meant i was able to use the pre-flight supper in the jfk lounge which is so much better than eating during the flight so i was able to maximise sleep. i couldn't have been more pleased with the service i received on both legs. when ba gets it right it is in a class of its own; friendly personal yet very unobtrusive service.,no
no,recently flew to eze and back from lhr. longest flight on the ba network. in each direction the crew were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. ife rather dated and choices were only average. food was ok better than last year on this route. actually had a very tasty steak out of eze which was pink great! but full english breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. on schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. baggage arrived very promptly. for once there were no long queues at eze. (buenos aires). i fly this route perhaps twice a year 3 years ago it was all pretty diabolical but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly and the food is slowly improving. no other direct flights from lhr.,no
no,"lhr-washington in club world. my disappointment continues with ba on the a380 club world seat. in theory being the flagship plane - it should have the flagship business class seat. as a regular traveller with ba i know the ""club"" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. what ba risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom will notice and take offence and fly with someone else. its a bit like the ba first product this used to have caviar on the jfk route and silver plated cutlery and krug champagne. now they don't. i notice because i used to experience it. meanwhile prices have shot up - and quality has shot downwards. very disappointing.",no
no,flight was cancelled with no explanation. no offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in thailand. my flight from bangkok to heathrow was horrendous. travelled world traveller plus which is a total waste of money. we were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. i was offered beef or fish. it was actually chicken. apart from a tub of ice cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. when the meal did arrive it was pasta or chicken. i asked for chicken. it was fish! it was also vile. sent it back. judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. i went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. i was advised if i wanted more tea could i retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! it was like being on some 3rd world airline. this is ba. supposedly the flagship airline of our country. it's an absolute disgrace. i have flown for over 40 years and never again with ba.,yes
no,flew from sfo to milan via heathrow on 2/14 returned 2/21. outbound was rescheduled due to changes requested by my company's business partner in milan. this was the third reschedule and ba charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. no other airline does this in my experience. incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless i paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. i did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. on the way out my antiquated in-flight display did not work. on the way back my headphone jack was broken. we left heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the ba website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at sfo. overall a very poor experience. i will avoid ba whenever possible.,yes
no,flew ba2043 gatwick to male in world traveller plus. plane a boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. the main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. the choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). i finally got my choice when the captain gave up his first choice! other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.,no
no,returning from st vincent late on liat airways we landed in barbados at 1750 for the 1755 flight to gatwick. the ba and virgin flights to gatwick were still on the tarmac. all virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight. ba customers had to fend for themselves and therefore missed the flight. that meant pleading for a seat on the 21.10 hrs flight. not good customer relations. i should add the supervisor at check in was brilliant though.,no
no,lgw-ams on friday 13th. flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time reason provided by captain was late inbound aircraft. (this was my third late running ba flight in as many weeks). no apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. i have two more flights in the coming month with ba rather regretting having booked with this carrier now.,no
no,beyond appalling. flight delayed by ten minutes departing rome to lhr. as a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in lhr. he was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. consequent late arrival to lhr. missed connecting flight. abandoned in heathrow at 10.30 on a sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. ground staff of no use whatsoever. staff totally unhelpful. taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum. correspondence/ contact with ba has been a joke since.,yes
no,"i have always travelled ba and have recently been upgraded to bronze which i would have thought had a few perks? wrong! my 15 year old son and i travelled from lhr-nyc on ba but it was a code-share with american airlines. i couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. ba at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though i had bought through ba! the flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. coming back we flew from washington dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. the plane which was an airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st feb. then ba announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! we were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! we sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! there was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. the final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! british airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. it's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part! time to look at a new airline to fly with.",no
no,i fly ba business regularly between delhi and london. i was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. the food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the delhi to london leg. also why not get some decent magazines - country life decanter the economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of hello! i residually like ba but they have to up their game.,no
no,flew from lax-lhr on ba's new a380. the crew are rightfully proud of their new aircraft and could not stop telling the passengers about its status. my seat was picked as 53k upper deck. i couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. the divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. the available width of ba's offering is a big disappointment. whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings i for one do not favour the casket-feel of club world. the a380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. i fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but poor attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. one alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. ba's menu for this flight was identical to a return lhr-mia-lhr leg i took back in early december. lacklustre choices and the infamous warm chicken breast salad. maybe i was tired and didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. i recently flew the a380 with af to lax in business and that was a role reversal! no limp and greasy bacon sandwich on af either. lax teminal b a massive improvement over the years. from fast immigration to pleasant design it's the leader in aspiring all us airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot! although and in summary is this solely enough in a demanding arena where those availing themselves of premium cabin experiences have quite the opposite.,no
no,"lhr-jfk. end of a one-world rtw trip. what a disappointment. after a mind-numbing trip through flight connections (ba to ba) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the b concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted to the f/c cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. the aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. very claustrophobic. seat was strange. very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on cx or aa. strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. the seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (indian style lamb) was virtually inedible. cheeses were good desserts and wines ok. evod was not to the standards of the competition. fewer movies and tv selections than either aa or cx. crew was fine. stick with aa/cx from now on.",no
no,cabin crew polite unfortunately ba ran out of chicken ran out of wine ran out of soft drinks. the food was awful. inflight service was a disaster - did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously ba overlooked this. to be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. i will never fly again with ba.,no
no,my wife and i travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to london. we travelled in first class. we did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. the staff on both legs were superb in every respect. the food was excellent and the first class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. comfortable clean and well appointed. we will travel with british airways every time we could not fault them in any way. just one minor thing that is no fault of british airways. when they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for first class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. i know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. we have travelled with british airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,yes
no,flew f class on the a380 iad-lhr-iad. iad lounge was charming great bar nice concorde dining room with good service nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. greeting staff very nice and bartenders that knew how to do their job. only the slightest downfall was in the club class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. station manager captain and inflight crew were was kind and generous with their time. food was decent champagne was great! ifs was strange and not easy to use but got help from fa's on both flights. arrival at t5 was shocking. like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto everyone started to tumble. processing through fast track however was a breeze. return. f check in is at the far end of the terminal agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. concorde room staff were delightful breakfast was nice massage was ok. train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. boarding for first was a snap fa's top notch food ok. arrival into iad was as joyus as surgery with long walks confusing machines little help. overall after reading so much negative about ba i was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at t5.,no
no,on a recent flight from johannesburg to london i was shocked to find such cramped seating conditions in the world traveller economy class section. having not been able to secure an aisle seat (which would have made minimal difference anyway) i was allocated a middle seat of 3. like many other men (and some women) i am over 6 ft. with long legs so the acute discomfort i experienced was manifest from the start of the flight to the end about 10 hours. it was difficult to stretch my legs and at times i had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp. it also caused me considerable back pain. i did offer to swap seats with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she was unwilling to do so that was her prerogative. so it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasions to take a walk along the aisles in order to alleviate leg cramps. the cabin staff were co-operative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence. reading very similar reviews it does make me wonder if british airways will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passengers (customers) in this appalling fashion. about 10 years ago i experienced an appalling flight from buenos aires to london via british airways (albeit for different reasons) and swore i would never use them again. but i felt i would give them one more chance. what a mistake. the world's favourite airline - don't make me laugh.,yes
no,heathrow to boston on what was once called queen of the sky now grandmother of the sky. went wtp on ancient 747 with tiny monitors with badly scratched screen and awful selection of movies and music. food just ok but crew very good. not worth the money better off in economy.,no
no,the flight was to dubai we travelled on the 9.45pm outgoing and 3.20pm incoming to heathrow. we travelled in economy the seats were cramped and hard. it was freezing cold so cold in fact passengers wore coats with a blankets on them as well. the food was awful no choice whatsoever. i asked for a coffee because i was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before i received it. the flight attendants on both flights did not look smart appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other. we have had better flights on easyjet.,yes
no,heathrow to washington a380 upper deck club world return. crew fantastic aircraft clean seats comfy food excellent both ways. cannot pick fault with anything apart from they advertise 50k as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out of a window from this seat. i think it's time ba invested some money on the gatwick club world cabins. the heathrow product is 100 times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference in standard of service and product delivered.,no
no,lhr-cdg return. the outbound flight was ok. nothing special as always. the seats are the new fitted seats for european flight. the meal was abysmal compared to af. the return flight was really annoying. one of the fa was rude. he looked bored and tired as it was the last flight of the day. he showed no interest in collecting the used cups. i know it was a short flight but it was just unacceptable. it's just a shame to see once a great airline is declining like that.,no
no,recently travelled to geneva return in economy from lgw excellent flights on time and very comfortable on board the b737-436 (g-docw/g-docx). ba provide a nice complimentary breakfast on ba2736 and drinks and snack on the return ba2737 no hesitation to recommend.,yes
no,ba 0058 cape town to london heathrow seats 03a & 04a. check in - directed to club world check in. one of our bags not labelled with first priority label. a little annoying as on the way out all first luggage was the very last off the carousel. boarding was via gate 2 and then through world traveller plus section. again annoying as that happened with boarding and disembarking on the way out. electrical problems with entertainment and lighting - resolved after two hours. no first amenity bags on board. no sleep suit offered as not on board either. seat for buddy dining kept collapsing. as it was the 1st of the month new wine list available. after one glass of mersault there was no more on board. offered 2 of last months whites as an alternative. butter at breakfast was rancid. needn't have worried about the bag without the priority label. it came of before our other bags! again first luggage came through long after most of the other classes of travel had cleared the baggage hall. we did disembark through door 1 however. crew pleasant and apologetic. why do we pay the extra? it's back to club world for us. time to start trying other airlines as well.,yes
no,"i have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. i just came back from a nyc-lhr-dubai trip and will not fly ba again. several reasons: my seat in business class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. when i told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. i was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""i would not get breakfast"". i was served raw chicken and when i expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? the dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that i was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with ba is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. as a customer paying nearly 10000 usd for a round trip ticket i shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. the seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. there are plenty of other first class carriers out there that i will now become a customer of.",yes
no,flew ams-lhr-jfk return 26th dec - 31st dec. ams-lhr-ams on a321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). they are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. lhr-jfk-lhr on b744 totally different experience. transferring through t5 at lhr easy enough although i got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the uk after all. also ba advertise t5 as like it's one building - not the case. all this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. they actually board a fully booked b744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges i felt this was totally unnecessary. turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly club world and first seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. how to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. prime example! service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. ife well just bring your own tablet. so dated it's just not worth switching on. the cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. arriving early morning from jfk of course we parked at a hard stand. waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. ba this is not acceptable. disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. but a fully loaded 744? come on.,no
no,out from lhr to jnb on 14th jan flight ba55 check in poor as we were e-tickets had nothing but passports and destination never had a problem before but was more like a quiz at a pub. also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at jnb and check in again at jnb for mub so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. we have never liked the premium economy seats on ba but connections in jnb made it necessary to travel ba. seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. crew were good. as far as airline food goes it was reasonable. return on ba56 on 29th jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you. when possible will always try to use virgin atlantic.,yes
no,flew from lhr to cai new years day business class - was absolutely superb. cabin staff were attentive and helpful flight was on time cabin spotless food excellent seats comfortable. my return flight economy again good helpful attendants food was fine seats appropriate and clean. even though the flight was at a time very high winds were present in uk the landing was skilfully executed and for me as a nervous flyer really i could not have asked for two better flights. i obtained online excellent prices for both flight prices relatively last minute too! no hesitation in flying ba at anytime.,no
no,lhr-lax-lhr economy. both legs on lower deck of the a380 professional yet friendly service plenty of drink runs between meal services. seat comfort superior to lh and af380s. travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. both flights arrived ahead of schedule. so far best transatlantic experience on an a380.,no
no,sydney to singapore return late jan/early feb 2015. the economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. the away leg (ba16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. the flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. another problem with the return leg (ba15) is that if you get on the plane in singapore and not in london by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. i wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. service on both flights was good. i was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. all the staff was nice and accommodating.,yes
no,"lhr-zurich. the trip got off to a good start as the north lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. had a nice early light lunch. the aircraft was a new a321. i like this plane. it was rammed end to end. the plane had the new club europe seats and it reminded me how well ba seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. as with the old c.e. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits ba they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. this was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide c.e. seat. at the same time justify the higher pricing. its no wonder ba have very few - if any - travel industry awards in the services they provide. so frustrating. i had another light lunch and a couple of gin and tonics which was nice. the fas were great. flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to zurich in 80 minutes which was great. the world's favourite airline? try ""the worlds most frustrating airline!""",yes
no,i flew club world from jhb to lhr on 21/01 on the 747. the flight experience overall was a good one. sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. the check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering i was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. i didn't use the lounge as i know the one in jnb is not very good. the boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. the food leaves a lot to be desired on ba i had the salmon main course which was very bland. the up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. the seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. the seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. arrival at t5 was very smooth as i used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. i would definitely fly ba again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.,yes
no,my wife and i flew business class lhr-hkg 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 e&f. check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. the lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. there was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied this was very well cooked and presented the thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous ba experience at hkg. we found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. the inflight food was very good i had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent i do think dessert and cheese should be offered. unlike our last ba flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. the ife selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the a380 (and very small compared to cx). thanks to the fa's we had a very enjoyable trip. we would fly ba again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the ba brand would be more competitive.,yes
no,flew business class den-lhr-auh-mct-lhr-den. flight crew excellent as always. food was pretty decent for airplane food. seat was comfortable and certainly better than sitting in the back of the plane. however we think this configuration is a failed experiment by ba. eight seats across is too many for business class. the seats were too narrow. the backward facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: if you are traveling with a spouse or friend and neither likes to face backwards you can't sit together. secondly when the divider is down you stare at a stranger 15 inches away. hope ba reverts to the old style one day.,yes
no,"flew back from milan lin on jan 4th. because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of lhr. no delay info given at check-in nor at gate. upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. my connecting flight to sfo was 2.5 hrs after landing in lhr. flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to sfo most likely too. upon landing in lhr a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. i was immediately told i was forced to miss my connection because my flight to sfo was on time. i was forced to join the longest line i've ever seen for rebooking. it never moved. we were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". crossing the border control took just as long. upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. i finally managed to join the free wifi and call ba's office to get rebooked online. i was rebooked on a flight from sfo to lhr. the wrong way around. when i pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. she finally called me back and got rebooked on aa flights to jfk and to sfo from there. the next morning at the aa check in they could not check me in on the jfk-sfo because of ""issues with the ba ticket"". it took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. i nearly missed the flight to jfk too. my suitcase was never loaded on that flight and i didn't get it at jfk. it took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. i will never fly british airways again.",yes
no,flew lhr-mia in wt+. seats 13e and 13f on 747. it was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal i managed to get around 5 hours of sleep. recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. food was ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! we were off the plane first at mia before first and club which was rather nifty. good experience.,yes
no,return flight from lhr t5 to washington dulles (iad) in club world. check in was fine even if the layout of the t5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. security was efficient. however the ba lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. outbound flight on the a380. boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. the club world cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. it was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. the club world seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. the entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat usb power socket was working. the general layout of the cabin was terrible. not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. it makes everything feel cramped and cheap. meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. overall i'd rate the outbound experience as 'okay' for a business class flight. return flight experience was far from okay. my flight departing iad at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. told that there were no club world seats on the earlier flight out of iad that night which i could just about make at a push and i would have to fly back in economy. when i asked about the ba flight from baltimore (bwi) an hour later i was told that yes there were club world seats available that evening so i asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. arriving at bwi check-in i was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any club world seats available and i would have to fly back in world traveller plus. the flight from bwi to lhr t5 was on a rather old 767. the cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. world traveller plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. in-flight food was bland. the crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. flight left and arrived on time. as a uk passport holder immigration at t5 was quick. baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.,no
no,mad-lhr-jed club world 777-200. the overall product still good but need some update on aircraft and seat desing. sometimes the window seat can fell a bit narrow with no extra space for your personals. on the other hand good service fast connection at lhr great lounge fa nice and attentive. ife good choice of movies nice food (not great). will fly them again.,yes
no,flew syd-sin-syd and all in all can't complain. service was excellent food excellent large wine choice. seats weren't much different to other business class seats we have experienced although i would suggest that couples don't choose window seats as they need to actually stand up and walk around to speak to their partner. seats in centre are adjoining with a sliding screen between. qantas first class lounge in sydney was fantastic with full restaurant service. singapore lounge very comfortable with plenty of seats. would definitely fly ba again.,no
no,"flew mia-lhr in first. seats 5a and 5k. this was my first time in ba first and i was really impressed. from the moment my boyfriend and i walked up to check in to the moment we left the plane we were very well looked after. the food was nice and particularly enjoyed the ""buddy dining"". my gooseberry crumble went down well. i got around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that was hitting the north eastern u.s made our flight very bumpy but also super fast. flying time being little over 7 hours 20 mins. i must mention the cabin crew who were very helpful and professional. we bought the seats in the sale and it was money well spent.",yes
no,lgw-acf-lgw (club europe) on both flights we had very good cabin staff infact the purser was the same on both flights and he was very efficient and very friendly as were both stewardesses. the food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. the new seat configuration on the airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but i'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! i'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and i found the loo cramped looking around i couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and i don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. a tall and big built person would not be happy! i gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. the seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and i kept sliding forward on mine. the leg rest has gone too so i had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.,no
no,miami to heathrow on 23rd january 2015. very old 747 with old style interior in economy. a real disappointment after a series of long haul flights in the new cabin. this really needs replaced. anyone who has not flown with ba before would leave with a terrible impression. seats worn cramped and many falling apart with outdated ife. food and drinks service usual good standard though. please ba get rid of this old interior once and for all. it really lets your airline down and does nothing for the passenger experience.,yes
no,we travelled ba in business class lhr to vegas before xmas and returned to lhr from san diego in january. business class travel is a rare treat for us and i can't understand why ba persevere with this unique forwards/backwards facing seating layout. to sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. the cabin crew were great food was below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal: poor choice and terrible picture quality. outbound we were upstairs on a 747 there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. given these circumstances this flight experience should have been fantastic. however given the negatives detailed above i would classify it as just about average. we returned on a 777 and my negative feelings are sadly the same other than we were stuck on the plane for 40 mins on landing awaiting buses to disembark.,yes
no,my wife and i flew to barbados late november i had pre booked seats online to and fro but on both occasions the seats were already occupied when we boarded the flight attendants attitude towards this matter on the return journey was at best rude unhelpful and indifferent. asking for a drink was a complete siege after 2 hours into the flight they claim that they had run out of galley drink supplies. on our return trying to obtain a refund for the pre booked seats proved difficult. overall b.a. has got to rank as one of the worst airlines to travel with staff with generally poor and indifferent attitudes penny pinching which is bordering on mean and poor legroom. sad to say this b.a but emirates and other airlines put our national airline to absolute shame.,yes
no,los angeles (lax) to london (lhr) in club world. january 2015. have not flown out of the tom bradley international terminal at lax for years but it's now much improved. check in and bag drop a breeze as was security and in the oneworld lounge in minutes. good choice of food and drinks and plenty of space. short-ish walk to the gate good welcome on board and drinks served quickly. couldn't fault any aspect of the experience and we took off and landed on time and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. love the arrivals lounge at lhr. a civilising shower and 2nd breakfast sets you up for the day.,no
no,"took a return trip to dublin over christmas and found ba to be extremely disappointing. my principal complaint is the dirt - the seats and floor area looked as if they had not been cleaned for many flights. also at 5'8"" i am not that tall but still found the seats cramped and uncomfortable.",yes
no,travelled business a380 lhr-hk and returned on 777 bkk-lhr. found t5 lounge great as usual seats were fine slept ok in the cabin. food onboard was tasty and cabin crew professional but friendly. wash bag was poor for business but hey it's not a deal braker. ife was ok touchscreen on both flights.,yes
no,ncl-lhr-ncl. first flight to lhr was great with an informative captain and friendly efficient staff on a refurbished a320. cabin is really smart. arrived into lhr early which is a pleasant change despite the enforced 'stacking' that happens to flights landing at heathrow. return flight was great too due to the captain and crew great service on a full flight however the a319 cabin was the old type and boy did it show! overall a good experience with ba.,no
no,flew bkk-lhr was fearing the worst having read the reviews on here regarding the aisle seats where people have to step over you to get out. relieved to say this didn't cause me any problems and i wasn't disturbed. found the seat to be comfortable in both the upright and flat bed positions. service from the cabin crew was adequately good. food average. entertainment system average.,no

no,london gatwick to mauritius 27th december return 7th january. 777 aircraft economy class. i never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. the seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. in the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. when the passenger in front put his seat back i couldn't use the tray and when i asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. ba are miles behind the far and middle east airlines and still charging more. i have no idea why people use them.,yes
no,bangkok to london heathrow. 8 sep 2014. on this flight british airways stinted on everything. i don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. british airways is not cheap. as soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. everyone had their airline blankets over them. there were not enough stewards/stewardesses. forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. seatback tv did not work in the section i was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. the seatbacks should be checked before the flight. however eventually they did work. a small number of films tv shows i have never heard of and no games option. first meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. and creamers! even for tea! whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. british airways even ran out of beer! ba hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! i resent having to pay to book a certain seat. the flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. never again.,no

no,dub-lcy (ba 4467) got the flight on sale for a pretty good price. great legroom on the e190 and comfortable seats quick and hassle free boarding. service was a bit slow but included a drink and a snack (enough for such a short flight of an hour) with the option for more if so desired. would recommend. lcy is going to be my airport of choice when going to london in future was sitting on the dlr 15 mins after landing and at my hotel 40 mins after disembarking and the trip on public transport was only £4.80 rather the excessive cost/time from other airports in the area.,yes
no,cpt-jnb-lhr. excellent slow lounge at cpt with outstanding food and 'loos with a view'. reasonable flight to jnb although 737 pretty tatty. ba galleries lounge at jnb not a patch on slow lounge. 2/2 layout on 747 upper deck felt superior to 2/3/2 on a380 outward flight particularly as less than 50% full. fas pleasant and food service managed well. food better than usual. ife not as good as emirates and screen inferior to club world on a380. flat- bed seats okay although narrow and hard.,yes
no,delhi to london in seat 2a 747 aircraft. very little difference between first and business in comfort terms and the food was disgusting. poor choice of entertainment. only good thing i can remember was a nice white burgundy but it was probably served in economy too. will stick to business class in future for the airport fast tracking and lounges.,yes
no,flying from lgw to mco on a 772. compared to last year the cabin was clean. wide variety of food and beverages. quality was good. ba is far behind a lot of airlines in business class. the seat is small if you are over 6 feet tall. staff ok. they don't go out of their way. it seems that they are just doing their job. you don't see them between meals. they need to step up their game. i don't think ba is a 4 star airline. i would only recommend because of direct flight.,yes
no,"lgw-cun club world seat 4a. to be honest i wasn't looking forward to this flight as it was one of ba's so called ""leisure flights"". however i was pleasantly surprised at the high level of service quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. seat 4a is recommended as you don't have to step over anyone to access the aisle. i was first on the plane and first off it just a pity my bags were not the first to arrive.",no
no,recently completed a round-trip lgw-barcelona. flying out i was in economy a bit tight but service was very friendly. only complaint would be that drinks took a long time to be served in fact by the time they reached the back it was well past an hour into the flight and long after the sandwiches had been handed out. a second drinks or coffee/tea service would have been appreciated. flew club europe on inbound (jan 7 13.40 flight) and although i'm not a seasoned business-class traveller i thought it was impeccable for the modest premium paid. 737 had the old layout so no complaints about seat comfort not sure if i'd say the same with the newer seating arrangement from what i've read on this forum. crew member serving the club cabin could not have been better - everything was served with the most gracious of smiles and the mood in the cabin was relaxed but convivial. food and drinks very good and appropriate for time of day and length of flight. miro lounge in barcelona top-notch. will definitely try to book club in the future.,no
no,lhr-hkg-lhr in first. a brief trip to celebrate new year in honkers. pleasant first class check in average fast track and warm welcome in the concorde room. escorted to a table for 3. excellent meal and service. my salmon tartare was nice enough and the lamb was very tender rounded off by a sticky toffee and date pudding which was good but next time more clotted cream please. i enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and a nice pinot noir. boarded at c64 escorted to my seat after a very warm personal welcome. champagne slippers pj's and an amenity kit proffered. crew seem excellent. they will also bring us home on new year's day. after take off drinks (bloody mary for me) and an amuse-bouche. my friends indulged in a full meal but i just had the cauliflower soup which was very tasty. my friend's profiteroles looked yummy. the crew were very attentive to us all. after being taken on a tour of the 777 by kim i slept for 4 hours or so before indulging in a full english. got changed before landing. an excellent flight with an excellent crew. coming home. after a pleasant supper in the qantas lounge we were escorted to the front of the queue and welcomed on board by our now familiar crew. champagne settled us down and after take off my dinner was predicated with an amuse-bouche of beef carpaccio prawn and balik salmon with olive oil caviar followed by lamb washed down with a rather nice medoc with a cheese plate conclusion. after a good night's sleep i woke to a cup of english breakfast tea and orange juice whilst my friends had the full works. quick disembarkation. ba at its best.,no
no,ba179 jan 6 2015 lhr-jfk. first. t5 is great for the first class experience with check in security and straight into the concorde room. the lounge and spa facilities are a great refuge while flying especially the dining room. the 777 has more room in the cabin than the 747 flight to london which i appreciated especially when it came to my bed. seat 2a is private and roomy. it was a full flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little rushed. overall the service was at the great ba standard. what was lacking was the meal was lacking the freshness and taste which was disappointing. there was major (1hr) delay in planing at jfk which was not ba's fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been. i would fly ba first again for the service stylish cabin and overall comfort.,no
no,london-gatwick to venice on 30 december 2014 everything went smoothly at check in no problems flight arrived safely. info given during flight. no gluten free option given for snack during flight but got vegetarian option. opted for a drink and own snack which i always have as stand by. cabin crew seemed rushed but polite.,yes
no,we flew from gatwick to jamaica in november. check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. the lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. as we were there around 09.15 i had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which i didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. the departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the cw passengers in to a separate area to board first. on board most things were ok and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. the return from kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. however this was compensated by an excellent lounge (club kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. as usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but i did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours. overall quite good and based on this experience i would recommend this product.,no
no,heathrow to newark on 787 aircraft. plane clean and tidy excellent in flight entertainment good food and drink served by friendly staff. overall excellent value for money. the galleries lounge at terminal 5b is an excellent space quiet for the time of day with plentiful food and drink.,yes
no,just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to thailand flying to and from bangkok with ba on 777 aircraft. i definitely would choose another airline next time. we flew out on 31st december 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. one of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. for most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. my inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. return flight crew on 16th jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. the inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. one staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. tray table was broken in seat 27b also. the crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what i call a night flight. i used to love flying ba as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and i am sorry to say neither my partner or i enjoyed the experience. will look to eva thai or one of the middle eastern airlines next time.,yes
no,washington (iad) to heathrow on christmas day returning january 5th. i find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of ba especially considering what they once were. having arrived at dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. okay it was christmas day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and i along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. the same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. again the other airline lounges were open. having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (i was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. we boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the a380. this aircraft is of course huge but the club world seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the boeing 777 or 747. it is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. ba seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the asian carriers. the crew were very good - friendly and attentive. breakfast before we landed was very average. the bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which i went for. check in for the return journey was lamentable at heathrow terminal 5. dedicated club world positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. the journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. i have always recommended ba to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for club these days ba need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,no
no,ba284 dec 29 2014. sfo-lhr first. great flight with seat 1k at the nose of the jumbo. cabin was half full so service was professional friendly and efficient. felt very much taken care of throughout the 10 hour flight. cabin looked good and seat was comfortable especially in bed mode. the sfo lounge needs some work as not really first class more business the entertainment could be a little better in selection and screen quality. overall a really good product with exceptional service which ba is known for in first.,yes
no,i have used british airways over a number of years for work and leisure trips non-exclusively and must say i have noted a gradual but continued decrease in service quality. on a recent return flight from johannesburg travelling with an infant we were delayed for over 30 hours. the way in which the delay was handled was terrible. minimal staff meant it took three plus hours to get checked in to a hotel. then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took 5 hours with two staff serving 400 passengers with no concern for customers. tried calling head office and they were less helpful than the booking agents.my intention is to avoid where possible and in many cases they are cheaper alternatives.,yes
no,lgw-mla. for some crazy reason i still fly british airways and pay for club europe. following this trip i have come to my senses. apart from a berlin trip already paid for in may they can say goodbye to my business travel. this was an airbus 320 previously owned by bmi. it was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the bmi banner inside. the plane was never used for business. all the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch. there was not even a curtain dividing club and economy. just how ba think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer i don't know. unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facilities then its low cost airlines for me around europe.,no
no,return trip (lhr to jfk) in business class. excellent trip. we were celebrating my wife's birthday on the way out and the staff were outstanding. professional attentive but also able to have a laugh with customers. the food was excellent and the wine selection very good as well. lounge at heathrow was also very good (t5 is a pleasure to use). return (overnight) flight also very good - efficient staff and seats comfortable enough to get some sleep.,yes
no,man-lhr-lax. flew manchester to lax via heathrow on christmas day in club world on the a380. check in and boarding were extremely smooth at manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.upon arrival lhr was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. when it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. there didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for club passengers. the downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in club world. once on board it was a fairly standard offering club world on ba is pretty consistent across all aircraft i now find. seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. my one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13a and 13b) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. the other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. whilst there's no doubt the a380 is a quieter aircraft i feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for club world tickets.,yes
no,miami to brussels with a change at heathrow terminal 5. lounge in miami was ok ample choice of spirits but very basic champagne. food: lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries. plane: rather dated 747 and not very clean. fa's very courteous and extremely friendly - great choice of very good champagnes wines and spirits. where ba fails: the poor quality of the food - extremely basic without any luxury items - not acceptable at all for a first product - ife just ok. seat kk - fa gave assistance for the sleeping position. connecting flight to brussels: i was informed by the - once again very friendly and courteous fa - that ba did cancel the fruit platter as a special meal. is fruit also too expensive? will move to other companies for long distance flights.,yes
no,"lgw-cun club world seat 4a. to be honest i wasn't looking forward to this flight as it was one of ba's so called ""leisure flights"". however i was pleasantly surprised at the high level of service quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. seat 4a is recommended as you don't have to step over anyone to access the aisle. i was first on the plane and first off it just a pity my bags were not the first to arrive.",yes

no,san diego-lhr-man. on 6th january we flew from san diego to manchester uk via heathrow. after flying out on christmas day via lax on the a380 this flight was a welcome return to form for ba's club world offering. the san diego admiral's club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the uk lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. when it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the a380 the staff at san diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. the cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. the entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the a380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. after a very average outward flight on the a380 into la this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in ba's club offering and means that for future trips to the west coast we will be flying direct into san diego rather than lax.,no
no,ba 870 22nd dec 2014. flew from london to budapest. very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional. even though this was a fairly short trip food and beverages were very satisfactory. will definitely recommend this airline.,no
no,lhr - helsinki in business class. i happened to fly on this flight as i booked a flight to shanghai with finnair in business and ba are a oneworld partner. although the cabin crew were very attentive i feel that club europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. the aircraft was a brand new a320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the club europe section. the seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. there is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. the generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. i have had better service in economy on ba short hall flights in the late 90s. furthermore i recently flew on a china eastern airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new a320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and i was served with a hot meal! there was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. i do like ba but if you are flying short hall and are considering club europe i suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. these low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.,no
no,flew on 23 december from shanghai to lhr in first. only 3 of us in the cabin so service was excellent and very personal. found the seat and bed both very comfortable and food and drink selection was excellent. ife wasn't amazing - found stuff to watch but easily got bored. first lived up to my expectations on ba and i'd love to repeat it.,no
no,wednesday 24th december - 787 dreamliner lhr to calgary in club - seat 3a. used the lounges and managed to get a free facial in the elemis spa. on entering the aircraft it was nice to see the big seats. however it took the staff at least 5 minutes to collect our coats. we were lucky we were travelling as a couple as it would be quite annoying if you were in 3b as the food is served over the dividing barrier. food was very nice. being next to the windows it was hard to hear the cabin announcements as the air circulation is quite loud. the windows are different as the change colour instead of the usual blinds. the seat design is very poor for those in seat a rows 1 2 and 6 as they have to step over the person in the row in front if they are lying down. 3a has its own access to the aisle. the seat is ok and does go to a flat bed but with it only being 6ft a lot of people will not be able to stretch out. disembarking was chaos as the people from the other bit in club and premium tried to get off before us. we managed to get seats for £1000 return in the november sale - i would not like to have paid the usual £6k return as it is not value for money.,yes
no,"being an ex pat i decided to fly the flag from seattle back to england in november 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. i was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. between us all we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. after a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! i wonder what genius came up with that one. aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. they wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. they didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything. as far as flying ba again there wont be a next time.",no
no,i flew to toronto from manchester via t5 heathrow on dec 17 returning on jan 5. i have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although i am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. what i found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at t5 heathrow. we were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. are there not enough gates with air bridges at t5? why is this necessary. i will be flying to toronto again in september but i am not sure it will be with ba if this situation persists.,yes
no,flew lhr to denver colorado on 26/12/14 - 6/1/15 for a ski holiday. absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what i consider as edible and what ba class as edible we shall truly disagree on - awful food. coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any? the inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. the male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway? thought ba had got rid of that superior lucky to fly with us attitude! will not fly them again if i can help it.,no
no,i only travel on ba as i am a sucker for the avios points! i am based in london and genuinely like lhr t5. over the years i have seen the gradual downgrading of club and first. very nice new equipment with the a380 but other than being quiet and having an excellent entertainment system nothing has really changed. paper salt and pepper sachets in club an amenity kit that is so poor its not worth opening. i mostly pay for my ticket and due to some excellent fares will fly club i can accept the downgrading as i sort of like the seat. first is now just about how club used to be what happened to canapés being offered as you sat down where is the eat what you want when you want service? krug champagne! i i use my avios when travelling in first i don't believe anyone pays a full fare in that cabin. don't get me wrong i like ba but just feel a little sad that the polish has gone from their premium cabins.,yes
no,after flying iberia mad-scl the return journey from buenos aires to lhr was underwhelming. old tired plane (777) with a 3-4-3 set up for a 13 hour flight (compared to a far more comfortable 2-4-2 on iberia) ife screens smaller than any other airline with very limited options uncomfortable seats with minimal leg room. fa's adequate as was the meal. i don't understand why ba is 4-star rated and iberia and lan are 3-stars or how they can charge much more than any other european airline? they don't even want to try and being british i am really disappointed with the state of our flagship carrier. how are they going to compete with emirates qatar etc?,yes
no,the last trip was in nov to washington flew first in the new a380 which is a great aircraft very spacious cabin and extremely quiet. service and drinks choice fine but their food is always questionable. on the way out had the tasting menu which was good even had two dishes repeated but on the return chose the chicken in a mushroom sauce! this was disgusting and after two bites sent it back. this is not the first time ba's food has been suspect either their club europe service to gibraltar also serves up light cold snacks though charging up to £750 return for a 2.5hour flight. for those looking to fly ba the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.,no
no,we flew from manchester to lhr to ycc and return over the christmas period on the dreamliner. the only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from london. the dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. we had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. the 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. we sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. it was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. the food was typical air line food. the crew were variable. on the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. the lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. we are returning to canada in a few months but we will not be using ba despite my husbands executive club membership. ba are still great for short haul but they need to rethink the dreamliner experience.,no
no,travelled from london heathrow to tokyo haneda overall not a very pleasurable experience. the seats were uncomfortable blankets were of poor quality. seats were crammed too close to one another the pillow provided was also of poor quality. the entertainment system was great for tv shows but terrible for movies only one headphone worked and occasionally the sound would black out the system suffered a few malfunctions but smoothed out once up in the air. the food was delicious but the tea and coffee was poor. staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement. the aircraft and the experience itself seemed old and dated compared to other carriers i have flown with.,yes
no,it was the first time flying on the a380 and for the first time in my life slept for about nine hours on the flight from heathrow to singapore. after reading reviews suggesting that the seats in world traveller were small and uncomfortable i was not looking forward to this long haul flight. all i can say is these seats are the most comfortable i have ever sat/ slept on. the cabin was quiet with excellent cabin crew. my only complaint is you have to know how to work the system to get the seats with extra legroom or upstairs!,yes
no,lhr-jnb-cpt. upper deck on a380. 2x3x2 arrangement far from ideal for the trio in the middle although dividing up the club world cabin helps. seats otherwise identical to usual ba business class. window seats are best because of lockers at the side. take-off remarkably quiet and smooth. dinner service quick - in marked contrast to recent emirates flight on a380. food actually very good including a main course salad with 'warmed salmon' which was as good as in any restaurant. slow disembarkation at jnb. huge confusion about whether luggage had to be retrieved and re-checked in (check in at lhr informed us it was ticketed all the way to our final destination) and where we had to go for domestic transfer. eventually arrived in excellent slow lounge 45 mins after leaving plane. 2 hr flight on 737 to cpt uneventful and quick baggage retrieval.,yes
no,los angeles - heathrow - los angeles over the holidays. club world is a perfectly fine business product. staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. portion sizes not huge but i don't need the calories anyway. plenty of drinks offered. an unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if i was ok and if i would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. in terms of product this is not a million miles away from united business (both even have backwards-facing seats). however the ba cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. united's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. just like with the 747 the upstairs on the a380 has side storage which is useful. the upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). but downstairs is light and roomy. on return on dec 29 i was delayed at the gate at heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. these company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the a380 from every crew member that passed. they acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. upshot? as long as ba doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the a380.,no
no,"my wife and i went from london gatwick to tampa on 6th november 2014. from our previous flights to this destination we knew already that there was not very much to expect. old 777 plane. loud tired staff not really interested just working on automatic. the seats were old dirty and shabby looking. no space cold and freezing on the legs. the very old screens in the seats are just a nightmare to watch. broken sound systems. the food topped the whole experience. just awful! full of preservatives. very degrading - even when you sit in the so called ""wooden class"". over the last 3 years i have been flying to tampa nothing has been changed by ba.",yes
no,lhr-sfo. i paid premium economy but upgrade with avios so it was good value. sat in the upper deck. fas were attentive helpful and accommodating. a good choice of beverages available and i consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. the club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches fruit chocolate cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. a light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing i had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. some excellent warm scones were provided. i was happy with my choice but my wife thought the salad too light for a secondary meal. overall the food was okay but i have had better on singapore airlines anz and even aa. the ife system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. on the return journey i slept most of the flight after the meal. my wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to heathrow. a very positive note to report the ba lounge at sfo is excellent a good choice of food and drink excellent space and i loved the direct access to the air bridge.,no
no,club world to st lucia on the 16th december and the service was dreadful - even for ba. when we boarded the aircraft my wife asked for a glass of champagne while we waited for take-off and the hostess said 'i would have to open another bottle'. she then walked away and did not return. given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many many times over. i like to watch movies or the map of our progress and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. you guessed it the video system did not work at all for me nor for several other customers around me. i did complain and have been offered compensation of £60 but only against the cost of another ba ticket. as far as i am concerned they can keep their voucher as my wife and i will not fly ba again - ever.,no
no,"british airways call themselves a ""full service"" airline. this they seem to think means providing a packet of crisps or a cookie with your drink of choice. how can it be called ""full service"" if they even run out of crisps on a 45 minute flight between london city and amsterdam? really poor.",no
no,"lhr-sfo-lhr. why do i keep thinking ba will improve? the 747 on this route is falling to bits. their business class configuration is terrible. facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! food on both legs awful but worse coming from sfo. also club kitchen pathetic. ife systems the worst of any airline. ba please travel on emirates just once and see how it should be done. staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to lhr on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. then empties sat on table for two hours before i dumped them in galley. breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. both of which left uneaten. i keep booking through blind loyalty but after bahrain and san fran in december decided no more. they have just got too bad.",no
no,muscat - abu dhabi - london. delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. no welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. no cabin checks done on one side ex abu dhabi. menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience.,yes
no,ham-lhr club europe seat 2f new cabin. dear oh dear - surely no one within ba could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. i find the new seat absolutely horrible. it's very tight and i am unable to use my laptop. flying ba club europe is no longer justifiable because its no longer possible to work during the flight. yes the luggage rack moved to eye level. it does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable. dear ba - please reconsider this terrible new seat an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.,no
no,ba662 26/12/14 lhr-lca economy seat 27k. 37 minutes late leaving heathrow but that's not unusual for this service made up some of the time but still arrived 30 minutes late into larnaca. flight was on an old boeing 767 - the seating was a bit too firm and not very comfortable. this seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. gets a little cold here but ok for a flight of this duration. no personal video on demand just old overhead screen system so next to useless. they replace the seats but not the entertainment system and on a flight like this of over four hours it should be better. food was pretty good with a choice of salad or hot meal with the usual free beverages. cabin crew were ok nothing special and we never got a pass by the duty free either for some reason they missed out rows 27j/k towards the back. flight crew gave good flight information and updates. luggage arrived ok at destination. so to sum up very ordinary very average very late.,yes
no,"travelled club from mia to lhr last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare aa flight (which was excellent!) we paid an extra £170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. it's been several years since i last tried ba club on a transatlantic flight and i was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. compared to the emirates business class i'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before ba are fast becoming the 'lada' of the airline business. the seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. the entertainment? really poor! but worst of all the food! i would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? the breakfast was a joke. a glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! my wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the cabin crew first offered her one then said ""oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! never again ba!",no
no,had a good ba flight out to barcelona but found on return switched to vueling. on this flight we had to pay for refreshments. i wrote in to ba to complain and had no reply. after several weeks i re-wrote and eventually received an apology but no explanation as to why we had to pay for food.,no
no,lis-lhr-vie on dec. 8 both legs on an airbus 320 in club europe (business class) - both legs on time seats were economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch – check-in in lis was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was ok. lis-lhr leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive european fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. other than that business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. at 11 am the business class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate). extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in heathrow after 1 pm. on the lhr-vie leg service was“afternoon tea”meaning again sandwiches. however this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. full bar service on both flights and the french white wine served was ok. the mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to ba standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. transfer procedures in lhr terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at lhr (even intra-eu) were hassle free and easy. ba’s galleries lounge in lhr t3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport; comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. in lisbon portela ba uses the shared blue lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited; some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good nespresso coffee. although small it was not crowded which is a plus. so ba delivered a good basic product for economy standards but i fail to see any real business class service offered here (not seat wise not meal wise not service wise). the only saving grace was the galleries lounge in heathrow t3 and the better service on the lhr-vie leg. not recommended for business class within europe based on this experience. (oneworld sapphire).,no
no,lgw to tfs in club europe. disappointing that ba has downgraded its ce service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul. too little leg room now such that new seats are no different from economy - yes the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and i would like is additional leg room. not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. new seats are uncomfortable as well. lunch service reminiscent of economy food trays of the 80s too. cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - ce clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer? can no longer recommend ba for a four hour short-haul although good time-keeping. such a shame that ba has allowed this to happen. think again ba.,no
no,flights lhr - prague return 1st - 4th december. very full flights. the online booking/check in system was down for 'technical reasons' for the 24hrs before departure. consequently my wife and i arrived at lhr well before check in time and were only offered two middle seats in different rows. how is this if the booking system was unavailable? the flight itself was 1hr late departing terminal 3 not terminal 5 as most other flights with ba. return flights bookable in prague so at least got to sit together. planes were pretty new airbus a320's comfortable and well suited to the 1hr 45m flight. the best bit was this was a short break booked via the ba website and included a very central boutique hotel and breakfast for under £250 each. a nice idea before christmas with prague looking it's best with a light dusting of snow.,yes
no,a380 to hong kong wt+. wonderful plane slept for a number of hours (which for me is all but unheard of). food much better than i was expecting considering that wt+ is supposed to get the same food as wt. plane left on time and arrived early. crew friendly - i had little call to ask them for much but any request was quickly attended to. return from bangkok incoming flight (and hence departure from bkk) delayed to atc in uk ba provided voucher which was more than enough for a good sized breakfast. 777 nowhere near as nice as the a380 noisy seats less comfortable and i got barely any sleep on this 13h flight. fas not as attentive as going out but no real complaints. poor choice of entertainment on very small screen. overall quite good and fair value for money in wt+.,yes
no,a380 club world hkg-lhr. overall a very good flight with ba. i had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. i find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. the half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. the inflight entertainment is excellent i do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and tv. the catering however continues to be poor with ba. while the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them. as this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapés starter sounded perfect they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. this to me is ba's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines. service from cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient and always calling me by my name wherever they see me in the cabin.,yes
no,"premium economy pricey but of questionable value. having flown ba long-haul twice previously in economy we decided to pay $900 extra round-trip for world traveller plus. all we got for the money was legroom. terrific because i'm 6'3"" but not worth the price. the trick to airline comfort - and there is no such thing unless you're flying business or first class - on a long-haul flight is to book the ""4"" section of 3-4-3 in economy and hope that the two people beside you and your travel companion are smart enough to figure out that the quickest way to the aisle is to go across one person not two. let's face it all you want from a long-haul flight are comfortable seats (and the new generation of thinner seats receives mixed reviews) and acceptable food. you expect safety and timely arrival which depends on weather and other variables not controlled by the airline.",yes
no,austin to london on a 787. difficult to quite place why a 787 is better but it is - noise in particular is lower. the 'enhanced' club world is a bit longer than normal with a different colour scheme. a very good dinner and a new ife system with lots of choice. as normal with ba service is good. almost a perfect flight.,yes
no,a very pleasant but flawed flight to dallas. on the plus side a very good lunch good drinks lots of privacy (difficult to see fellow passengers) a very comfortable seat and an excellent crew. however the ife had limited choice and the second 'meal' served 8 hours after take off was a few sandwiches. not difficult to put this right and turn good into great.,no
no,lhr-sfo - club world. i find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding ba's premium products. online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. that is it! whoever designed the club world seat needs to have their head examined. the board that signed off on the product should be fired! the seat was narrowed with no space to put your drinks without lowering the dining table. that is just plain stupid. having to step over another pax to get out of your seat (if seated in window) is another stupid concept! the design offers absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle. the food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class (compared to the likes of air france or lufthansa). entertainment selection were poor but better than klm and the screen not of good size. fly crews were ok. i ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same. even though my order was first my neighbour got the last order. fair enough ended up with turkey roulade was ok. the crews were apologetic but not attentive. having flew other carriers i can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame. had an opportunity to look at the 1st class menu. to be frank any carrier who does not offer caviar's in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. making this observation because in 2 months i will be travelling to mexico and the price comparison between lufthansa and ba are not far apart (former slightly less) but i suspect flying lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than ba based on the experienced of this journey. will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the (+). i would not pay the published c or f class fares on ba. the product line does not equate to the price. ba was the waitrose and is now between tesco or asda.,yes
no,flew lhr-cph in business class on 23rd december 2014. new cabin and seats are a vast improvement and the new clean planes are good. food was ok with an afternoon tea. lots of drinks offered and the flight caught up the delay on departure. nice friendly staff too.,yes
no,my wife and i flew business class upstairs on the a380 hong kong to lhr flight ba 26 on the 21/12/14 seats 51 k and j. we found the seats comfortable and the window seat was private with plenty of storage my wife found the reverse to be true of the aisle seat getting out of the window seat is quite tricky. we found the food to be quite tasty. we had the beef tenderloin for dinner which was cooked nicely and tasted very good. the cooked english breakfast was also good. the plane was clean and new looking and the toilets were clean and fresh. staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head fa was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude. will we fly ba again after our return on the 23/1/15? maybe if they are considerably cheaper or cathay pacific are full.,no
no,san-muc for a conference. i hold oneworld sapphire status yet the ba website didn't recognize and wanted to charge me for advanced seat assignments. after several phone calls with no solution ba finally called american airlines to verify my status and assigned my seats in advance. check in at san was cramped and disorganized. no offer to upgrade to the next class of service (biz class was only 1/4 full). lounge was amazing! boarded the 777-200 3 class service. the plane was outdated. no outlets to charge iphone/ipad. pvod screen was slightly bigger than an iphone 6 screen. pvod control on the inside of the seat. one slight move and the volume or channel changed. very frustrating. the cabin crew clearly couldn't care less about the passengers. meal service wasn't started until 2 hours after take off - very slow. seats were hard and chipped and broken. i'll never fly the san-lhr route again with this equipment. i had better expectations. turkish and anz premium economy are significantly better. however i switched back to oneworld and don't have many choices. ba needs to up their game if they expect to remain competitive in the global world. aa is even better in economy.,yes
no,really like the new business class cabins on the ba a380 (lhr-jnb) - the dimmed lighting is so civilized and much more conducive to long haul travel and getting some sleep. why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality great menus also good entertainment selection. didn't even notice takeoff (which was delayed) as movies etc available before take off. very good.,no
no,"washington - lhr. we arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new ba executive lounge. it is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. the food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. no complaints so far. we were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the a380. seats 50a and 50b. i was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. i hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. it was the so called latest club world seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. in fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. it has been some time since i have flown club - the last being on a 777 to antigua in 2010. i am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. we pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed i well put it this way tried to get some sleep. it was a horrendous experience. in 35 years of aviation travel i have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! i simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. the temperature was fine. noise level was minimal. the ""bed"" was rock hard. to narrow. to short. the seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. i arrived into lhr without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. i had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 club product - and back then i was 20 kilos heavier. this product is not cheap (on some sectors its as high as £7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on avios - with a 1st class outbound and club return. the saving grace was a strong tail wind that shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. i couldn't wait to get off.",yes
no,the tv is the worst i have ever experienced and i mean of all tvs ever not just airline tvs! the contrast was non-existent and the resolution appalling. it was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see!) it wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and i could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of tvs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. the tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. the table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. power sockets on a flight originating in the uk and run by a uk airline should be uk sockets not us sockets! the food was adequate but nothing special i've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! it had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! finally when the club world cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any. all in all this isn't the level of service that i expect when paying nearly £3000 for a flight. it was my first time flying club with ba and i had expected a level of service equivalent to business class with other airlines how wrong i was!,no
no,lhr to bkk outbound on boeing 777 sin to lhr inbound on boeing 747. outbound flight delayed (which seems to happen on a regular basis for this flight) which meant a missed connection in bkk. flight ok but the catering was ridiculous on a 11 hr sector only 2 choices which meant they ran out of chicken after about 5 rows and everyone else had to make do with the vegetarian option. flight back was on time still only 2 choices of meals but the crew were excellent very friendly and approachable. the ife was very limited compared to the middle eastern carriers and ba really do need to up their game if they're to compete with emirates etihad and qatar on these routes. it's also much easier to fly with those airlines if you are from any part of the uk other than london and the southeast of england as ba only do long haul from lhr and lgw.,no
no,british airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. the cancun route and the nassau routes i have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. this saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. one example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems i encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as ba only allocated one packet per person. the staff all agree that this was pathetic! no lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.,no
no,flew gla-lhr-jfk return trip on 3rd december returned on 8th. domestic flight was excellent both ways the new cabin is lovely breakfast was very good cabin crew very professional. lhr-jfk sector was excellent. although the 747 cabin is extremely worn the aircraft are being replaced in due course. the crew were very attentive and provided plenty of drinks the meal was lovely too. on the way back the turbulence was severe and there were a lot of frightened passengers the crew were very calm and reassuring and helped ease anxieties round the cabin.,yes
no,flew with ba back in june from london heathrow (lhr) - rome (fco) outbound in club europe return in economy. outbound flight on an a321 in business great service relaxing and comfortable improved greatly being addressed by name by the crew who were very funny and friendly great food and drinks on flight leaving london at 8:30 in the morning. return on a 767 in economy great service and very relaxing brilliant food and drink even in economy and once again friendly crew and brilliant seats. after a few trips over the months it appears ba is definitely improving with such brilliant service!,yes
no,tpa - lgw on dec 10th in pe. ba have total monopoly on the london/tampa rout and don't they know it. i fly this about every six weeks or so normally in club world but sometimes in premium just due to the huge price variance. the quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception. old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service. i pray every time i fly that another carrier will take up a slot at tampa as it's a growing airport and when they do ba will definitely lose my business and i suspect many others.,no
no,"lhr-washington on a 777-200. trip got off to a good start in the ba concorde 1st class lounge. nice champagne and a nice quiet ambiance which i like. the place is starting to show signs of wear and tear - with sagging seat cushions. plane was latest 1st class and there was only 7 passengers including my wife and i. it seemed a little larger than the 1st i travelled on a month ago on an a380. maybe it was because of the hideous centre console (that houses he folding table) was smaller - rather than take up half the space. to start we had a small ""appetizer"" (an amuse bouche) which was absolutely hideous. a sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. it was foul and we left the lot. both had a langoustine starter which was ok. the mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. the soup we both had was nice. my cod dish was very good. my wife said the steak two ways was ok. the braised part she did not eat. wines all ok. service from the fas was fine. in terms of overall quality ba really fail consistently to deliver. as a matter of curiosity i sourced the on way price the day before we left; £5543 - one way. its an insane price and if i paid that i would be furious as to the product i experienced. travelling in 1st is only worth it on ""sale"" offers or avios. we are travelling back in club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in first is not worth the money or the avios. so disappointing. ba really are clueless when it comes to understanding ""quality"".",no
no,sfo-lhr-sfo in premium economy in december 2014. outbound flight - an older 747-400 showing signs of age. crew not too friendly and were not seen after dinner service. only one drink offered. quite impressed with dinner filet of beef which i believe was from club menu. breakfast sadly was a cold croissant and jam. return flight much better with attentive crew. double dose of drink was a nice start. again served a filet of beef from club menu which was very good. older 747-400s need retiring very soon. premium economy seats are ok but get cramped after a few hours of sitting.,yes
no,lhr to mia on 12/8/2014. pros: lighting window blinds large tv personal storage pjs and food. cons: seat does not conform to lounge chair without activation of sleeper section. no bedding provided except used throw pillow from last seating. four middle seats crowd the area too much. bathroom very small. cabin was very very dirty. advise fly aa 777 or 77w on same route.,no
no,london-prague-london. smart new-looking a320 from t3 which was nice. early flight so no delays ahead of the atc cock-up that day. good crew there and back on time and generally excellent service. the one thing which places ba apart from easyjet (i won't even mention ryanair) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands. on easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the aisle whereas on ba things move much more quickly.,yes
no,very satisfactory flight with british airways from london to bangkok. was expecting the worst having read some of the reviews on here. i had one of the window seats where you don't have to climb over somebody to get out and this seat compared favourably with some of the higher ranked airlines as it offers excellent privacy. everything from check in to departure was seamless and apart from the avod which is pretty dated everything else on board was very satisfactory.,yes
no,vie-lhr on nov 29 on an airbus 320 in economy - straightforward evening point to point flight with a mixed fleet crew. flight departed on time and landed ahead of time in heathrow which is a rare thing these days. no luggage to check and web check-in was working fine. plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. mixed fleet fa's were pleasant however the service was not particularly well organized. it took them quite some time for the service to start and it took more than 30 minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. on the other hand the bacon sandwich was actually good and full bar service was offered. other than the “required service” of sandwich drink and duty free the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. service not quite up to usual ba standards. ba uses a shared lounge in vie which this time was quite busy but not overcrowded. lounge as such is acceptable but far from great. still believe that ba offers one of the best economy products on the european market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience. (oneworld sapphire).,yes
no,man-lhr-zrh and return. very smooth online check-in and seat selection. lightly loaded flights so i ended up with an empty seat next to me on every leg of the journey. the catering was pretty basic the usual crisps biscuits or nuts but a full complimentary bar. every flight was on time or early - when the return flight arrived at lhr ahead of schedule they even agreed to rebook me on an earlier connection to man which then also arrived early at man. all in all an impressive experience.,yes
no,great experience on ba glasgow to prague via heathrow outbound 3/12/14 inbound 6/12/14. immaculate refurbished aircraft seats very comfortable. great breakfast unexpected from glasgow and tasty filling sandwiches on the prague flights. only quibble is very scanty snack on evening flight back to glasgow. very good value package city break to prague from glasgow.,no
no,"flew return (lhr to lax) on the a380. condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. ba had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. this was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. the food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which i first flew with ba about 15 years ago. service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. the downside was the seat design. ba is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. this makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that i experienced back in the 90s). this made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. all other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. the worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after i asked him repeatedly. this resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. the cabin crew just shrug me off when i asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes. come on there is a big difference between good service (not upsetting customers) and just avoiding difficult situations.",yes
no,jfk-lhr b747. brilliant flight - namely because of the flight attendants. they were really friendly - not hurried in what they were doing and seemed genuine. the product on this older 747 wasn't great. it was nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in premium economy - but the tv screen was tiny and you could tell it was just an out of date aircraft and needed updating! food was absolutely excellent - beautiful lamb cutlet and beef cheek - best food i've had on an aircraft. quick flight - reasonably comfortable and would definitely fly again!,no
no,"i cannot believe that ba calls their plane from austin to london a ""dreamliner"". i'm sitting in their so called ""club world"" which is the equivalent to americans business class and this plane is awful! there is no room to put anything at all. everything and i mean everything goes in storage. you are literally looking straight at the person next to you. attendants are rude. don't waste your money. while its nice to go non-stop between austin and london this will be the last time i ever take this flight.",yes
no,ams-lhr-jnb and cpt-lhr-ams in club. 767 between amsterdam and london is just wonderful love the front cabin. a380 to jnb. this was a late departure. i could see - from the lounge - the a380 arrive at the stand some 30 minutes prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn't require a lot of inside-knowledge to see that such a plane can not be 'turned around' in 60 minutes. however ba did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it's premium passengers from the lounge and had them lined up in 4 separate lanes in front of the counter then announcing a delay of 15 then 30 then 45 minutes: how to get your most appreciated customers furious never hear so many complaints on an airline even before the flight started: terrible ground management: not a good start. upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time i had to use earplugs. food was just terrible and how ba gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me. the flight to jo'burg was obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor. that opposed to the 'new crew' on the way back from cape town. old 747 with spacious seating all fine. crew stressed running all the time no manners no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor. food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other european carrier i flew. it was my first time in club on ba i love the seat very comfortable for sleeping. there is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that: a really nice product. ba lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food). transfer at lhr t 5 was quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how - so soon after being delivered as new - half of it was blocked for remodelling. my return to amsterdam on a new a319 was great. good breakfast and seating is fine.,yes
no,travelled jfk - lhr late november. the concorde room: very nice indeed food not that good for once. seat 1k: fine comfortable enough but no space at all for small things - even the wardrobe had no storage space. just room for the coat and shoes below. this compares with american airlines business class which had essentially the same seat loads of storage space and good privacy. aa business class is equivalent to ba first class. the service was fantastic as always with ba. cup of tea excellent and breakfast good. toiletries bag was fine with all the items needed. toilet a bit naff for first class. value for money simply because the deal i got was really good - ba always do deals late november. otherwise it would have been poor value. however aa are preferred - ba do not have wifi.,no
no,"we flew ""business/1st class"" from london to dublin and then berlin to london recently on an airbus a-130 (like a 737). three seats on a side. the only thing different from coach was they put a tray table over the center seat. the seats were as cramped as southwest airlines. the service was excellent but the seats made it a bad deal.",no
no,lgw-tfs in november 2014. flight left gatwick at about 0900hrs to arrive tenerife at 1340 hours. we were served a croissant and cereal bar plus coffee and a yoghurt at about 1000hrs. no further trolley service at all during this four and a half hour flight. on the return leg leaving tenerife at 1415hrs we were served a wrap and a cheese roll with either drink from the bar or hot drink. the drinks were served after the meal. no further trolley service. the seating configuration was tight to say the least and i am 5'8. this felt like a budget airline flight. the captain asked us to enjoy british airways hospitality!,yes
no,bgi-lgw premium economy august 2014. silver tier status. older plane with older version of ba pe seat. adequate leg room though. cabin crew barely visible for the 8 hour flight and quite short tempered when they served dinner and breakfast. on ba website pe meals advertised as being a choice of two dishes off the business menu. we were definitely served an economy meal for dinner which was fairly average. breakfast before we landed in lgw consisted of a hard cold croissant with jam and fresh orange with tea/coffee. at the end of an 8 hour flight this was really disappointing and i would have been disappointed with this in economy never mind pe. when i asked a flight attendant about this i was treated abysmally. overall it is not worth paying extra for pe taking into account the poor standard of meals but especially the lack of courtesy and basic manners shown by cabin crew.,yes
no,amsterdam for two nights on business. used ba. i have to say that their economy euro product is good and covers all angles for smooth and efficient journey. check in at lhr t5 takes seconds and security minutes. the aircraft was the early-bird and was full. breakfast snack and tea served minutes after take off. even a tea refill offered. good value for money too.,yes
no,lhr to seattle return in wt+ a thoroughly enjoyable experience on each journey. both flights more or less on time with excellent crew on both legs very attentive and cheerful with plenty of drink runs and quite tasty meals. entertainment quite good with a huge choice of movies tv and music. on arrival into seatac i was through immigration and customs with my luggage and in my limo in under an hour. on arrival into heathrow terminal 5 it took about the same amount of time. i've been flying this route for the past twenty five years on average two to three times a year and ba is certainly the best airline flying to seattle.,no
no,"lax-lhr-lax on the a380.the first thing i noticed: you can no longer upgrade with avios. unlike the days of ba miles any attempt just brings up ""no availability"" or the web-site simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. not a good start. next up at lax the plane was a good hour late arriving. finally boarded and the flight was ok. food was from the club world menu (wtp) seating fine enough wine good ife but then landing late at lhr a delay because ""an airbus was at our spot"". next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is in our spot. over 35 minutes wasted sitting there with children bullying passengers. if the pilot wishes to lie please be consistent. route back all quite normal but i feel somehow ba have thrown the baby out with the bath water. as a share holder i prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad i preferred using miles to upgrade (try finding flights from the us you can book with ""avios"" and finally why did that pilot lie to all of us sat there waiting to park? time to stop collecting miles change credit cards and look for an honest airline i feel.",no
no,phoenix to london - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. the problem we had started on our return flight home. we boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. after being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. i was attempting to work but when i went to plug in my laptop battery i found that there was no adapter for me to use. since i could no longer work i decided to put a movie on. the tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. the flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and i give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. i decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. you can imagine my surprise when i saw him sitting in business class with a tv screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. at this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. it doesn't make sense to me. just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in phoenix to face another issue. we waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in london. we've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. the difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told.,yes
no,lhr to ist in economy. excellent! i thought it was a new a320 but fa told me it was not new it was refurbished. well done ba on a good re-design: new lighting seats clever seat-back storage etc. i believe they've reduced the economy seat pitch but the design is such that you don't notice. dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. a very decent meal for a 4-hour flight in economy. fas were courteous and efficient. the only negative was security at lhr t5 where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning.,yes
no,lhr-hel club europe / hel-lhr economy. club has improved a lot. great service from staff. greeting you by your name. however the food was just cold cuts and salad - dessert thin slices of fruit. the new seats are not very comfortable but i sat in the first row so had ample leg room. not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. the return in economy was fine. again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice. in economy you were served a sandwich and drinks including beer. i fly the same route regularly in finnair and ba is a superior service. the flight attendants did a good job. not overly friendly but quite attentive. the lounge at lhr terminal 3 is ok but breakfast was pretty bad. egg muffins with no taste at all - do recommend club europe but only when not paying top fare.,no
no,iah-lhr b747 which was old but sat upstairs and it made it very pleasant. they charged $129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. the food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. felt like i was in economy. nuts were in a bag and breakfast was not much better. flight attendants not very friendly.,yes
no,yvr-lhr-ams. an uneventful journey with ba but their boeing 747 from vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. the in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. the cabin crew were courteous and friendly. arrival and transfer in ba's terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. the connecting flight to amsterdam was a modern airbus a319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. unless ba revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with virgin air canada or even air transat for the vancouver-london route.,no
no,have just completed four flights with british airways all in economy and all long-haul. two were on the a380 one on the b787 and the fourth on a refurbished b777. so they all had the new seat. i find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. the seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. at 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. the 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. on the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. i'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. food ok - my special meals came as ordered. flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. heathrow t5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (a) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.,yes
no,british airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. we made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. this was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. it is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. when we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. while it's always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with british airways again.,yes
no,ba216 from washington to london in world traveller plus on ba's new a380 (upper level) - one of the smoothest quietest flights i've experienced in 45 years of flying. practically everything went off perfectly - less jet noise than on other aircraft decent food great leg-room and seat width a relaxing cabin layout and a top-notch cabin crew (no rating for entertainment since apart from the flight tracker i don't use it) - even the boarding and disembarkation despite being on two levels seemed more orderly than in the past on other aircraft. a success all round.,yes
no,lhr-bgo on a319. flight on time and only half full. drinks and snack on this early departure. crew very good.,yes
no,lhr-sfo-lhr. out in economy and return in economy plus both in a 747-400. outbound seating was in the v2 configuration meaning that no exit seats were available but did manage a bulkhead seat which made the journey more pleasant. staff on this flight were quite poor forgot to serve me dinner and disregarded the call button literally had to physically stop the steward in the aisle to get service. return in pe cost an extra £240 which is quite steep but the dinner was better as was the space and seat. service on return was excellent. breakfast really disappointing cereal bar and a bag of dried fruit who on earth in management in ba came up with this menu?,no
no,"i feel as though i am the only traveller in the world who has not enjoyed the experience on the dreamliner. i've travelled with ba for the past 30 years. when on business i travel business class and when on personal travel it varies between economy and club - depending on distance and budget. this year i travelled to toronto on vacation and were assigned economy seats on the new dreamliner. we chose not to upgrade seats as the dreamliner blurb gushed about seat space. how foolish we were. at just 5'7"" and 5'4"" respectively we are not in any way shape or form giants. but the absolute honest truth is we were squashed in tight. the restricted space was possibly not so much the leg room but the seat width - but letting the table down for food/drink was snug. outside of the seat space issue everything else was superb. inflight entertainment equipment was familiar easy to use. boarding in uk and toronto was smooth and helpful ground staff were always visible and proactive in offering and helping passengers. entertainment itself was varied and instantly accessed. food was reasonable. drinks were available with meals and upon request. crew were unfailingly polite professional and impeccable.",no
no,lca-lhr in club europe. decided to check a bag in to see how t5 baggage arrivals performed. pleasant check-in experience. security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. the cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded. wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers all of whom get ultra priority boarding. so boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst business class was almost full economy wasn't. on-board service was ok. hot towels no menus drinks and a 3 course meal salad main dessert or cheese but somehow the service was not as impressive as my outbound. queue longer to get through the e-passport channel than the regular immigration route but at least arriving in the baggage hall our bag was on the carousel. all in all a satisfactory flight.,yes
no,travelled first class - ruh to edi via lhr. stress-free luxurious and totally pleasant experience. the cabin crew were well-turned out friendly and welcoming and they maintained a quiet professional air that reassured me as i'm not the most confident flyer.,yes
no,lhr-hkg b777 club world. i was lucky enough to book a window seat at the back of the club world cabin which meant that i had direct aisle access without stepping over someone else's feet or them mine and my meals did not need to be passed over the person next to me. i found the seat very comfortable and while it is slightly narrower than others it has a lot of flexibility with the foot stool and the reclining options. the backward/forward facing seats is not ideal although did not upset me as much as others. as i was travelling with a friend the potentially awkward intimacy was not an issue. ife was excellent with a large good quality screen and an extensive library of films and tv. food was fairly disappointing possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure although really they should be resilient to that. drinks and service were both very good british airways offer a very efficient and professional service although it is not always overtly friendly. personally i like this but it could be seen as a negative depending on peoples expectations. galleries lounge in lhr t5 was excellent. peaceful and comfortable with a good selection of drinks and reasonable food. overall it was a solid product and one which i look forward to flying again. ba do need to improve their catering on board in order to compete better with other airlines.,yes
no,london to istanbul and return - economy class. the seats were leather and comfortable staff polite beautiful service. food was delicious and the drinks served was nice. i always liked ba's wine selection and they proved it again. there were no individual tv's but they did play a movie on both the flights so that killed time. boeing 767 flight have enough leg space. a happy on time flight with good service. always satisfied with ba.,yes
no,nbo-lhr club world and lhr-bos in economy: generally a pleasant and comfortable experience. i have difficulty reconciling our positive experiences with the negative comments about flight attendants in other posts here. as we boarded in nairobi the purser welcomed us by name and said how pleased they were to have us back again on ba. before take-off from london a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us. in all cases attendants were helpful cheerful and efficient. obviously in club world staff have more time to spend with passengers. with the exception of the late night dinner out of nairobi we were impressed with the meal selection and quality. flights were on time; checked baggage arrived in good condition. agree that having to pay to reserve seats (if you are not of sufficient one world status) is disappointing. generally we remain very pleased with british air certainly the best one world option to europe and beyond from boston.,yes
no,can't say anything negative about british air. our flight was cancelled in philadelphia due to mechanical problems. they put us up in a quality hotel gave us meal vouchers and kept us informed of the flight status gave us an extra day at the hotel since it was a late flight. i missed my connection to dubai had to wait at heathrow for 6 hrs. missed 2 days of work but can't get angry they did all they could and would fly ba again.,no
no,i had not flown ba long-haul for over 30 years before this flight. i flew yvr-lhr as the final sector of a round- the-world trip and i have to say i will not be in a hurry to repeat the experience. the 747-436 looked tired and ready for a refit or the breakers yard. the seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat i have ever sat in despite the headrest 'wings' which are a nice feature. the lower part of the seat backs are fibre not hard plastic enabling the passenger behind to put their knees into the small of your back. this happened frequently throughout our bumpy flight. the cabin service was lacklustre and the breakfast unappetizing. its a shame that our national carrier has such a mediocre product compared with emirates or air nz. if i was a teacher i would mark ba as 'can do better'.,no
no,recently flew with british airways on europe trip. one of our flights was delayed due to fog in london so we missed our connecting flight to paris. had to stand in a queue for over three hours waiting to be reallocated another flight. only 3 staff serving 200 people. not even water was offered to people waiting in this long queue. awful customer service would not recommend to anyone.,yes
no,cph-lhr-cph october 2014. air travel just keeps getting better. the latest boon on ba is the mobile phone boarding pass app. wonderful. no more searching for a printer making life so much easier. well done ba!,no
no,on past experience i chose ba for our long haul return flight to south america from the uk. not until i got to the payment stage did i realise that of the 4 flights only one short flight to madrid was actually on a ba plane. the others were with iberia airways. i understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. standards were very poor. no inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food. what is this a budget airline at full blown prices? again on this last leg the toilets weren't flushing! so at oyr destination they were almost full. my advice would be check who you're actually flying with.,no
no,check-in in toronto was ok no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. lounge in yyz was nice pre-flight dinner was just about ok with modest quality wines offered. chose an aisle seat yyz-lhr bad idea. seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the window seat passenger who appeared to be a ba staff member who was determined to drink all night. didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. decided on a window seat for the return lhr-yyz. bad idea again! very claustrophobic. during the entire flight i managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. thereafter no matter how many times i pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. no offers of cognac or liqueurs. dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. when i say over-cooked i mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. hadn't flown ba for a number of years and being a brit thought it would be a pleasant change from air canada on this route. it was a change but not a pleasant one. it's back to ac for me. their business class is way better than this experience. perhaps i was just unfortunate. on the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.,no
no,london city to florence. lcy is a great stress free airport. on time flight great crew and a really good economy service. we expected the usual ba biscuit or snack but were served a tasty couscous and chicken salad with dessert with plenty of drinks. ba offers a good product from lcy.,yes
no,hkg-lhr-bergen: stockholm-lhr-hkg - a380 on long haul/a319 for short haul. i always like the forward club cabin on ba's a380 upper deck despite the 7-across seating making it seem a bit cramped. short delay to outward sector due to technical problems some of which had not been ironed out on take off. the screen dividers ife and then the seat reclines had problems and required resetting. it was an hour before these were sorted out. my main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. the qantas lounge in hkg is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight. also skipped breakfast as there is an excellent one in the arrivals lounge. with ba having cancelled the morning flight to bergen about 5 months after i booked my ticket i was stuck with a lengthy 12-hour connection. en route to bergen the service for just 10 club passengers was poor - way below expectations. with only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish curry that no-one wanted (curry on a norway flight?) 4 of us were stuck with sandwiches from the back. no tea or coffee service unless specifically requested. return to lhr from stockholm was a huge improvement. friendly service quick drinks service and tasty lunch. slept most of the way back to hkg again deciding not to eat or watch any ife. in that respect the flight was excellent.,no
no,san francisco to london heathrow in august - appalling. i flew to lax on the a380 which was ok but flying back on the ba 747 was a truly forgettable experience. it was in such poor shape and the staff were hopeless. the inflight entertainment was virtually non existant and seating was cramped. i flew the next day onto hong kong with cathay which is head and shoulders above ba. for the amount it costs there are so many better alternatives.,yes
no,sfo-lhr-dxb and return dxb-lhr-den outbound in premium economy return in business. positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. was able to upgrade return at check in at dxb for about $1000 which i thought was worth it. i was not too impressed with wtp product - i still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. the 747 the product looks old and tired. menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. catering out of lhr was absolutely atrocious - almost like a tv dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. return in club world was a decent product. lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy. overall an okay experience but leagues behind ek/sq/cx. not sure when european airlines when if ever will catch up.,yes
no,i travel to and from singapore on ba in club world most months but this was my first time on the a380 for this trip. on the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. positives for this flight - good lounge in singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded. club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (i was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. excellent bathrooms - really spacious. one member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service larger film selection than on the 747 negatives - the food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. i will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.,yes
no,"flew with my wife lhr-jnb ba055 on an a380 october 31st and back jnb-lhr ba056 november 15th in business class. british airways has invented ""high density business class"" or ""sardines business class"". 8 abreast on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange. to be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. you are facing your neighbour and if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all. you have no view outside except if you have a window seat. you have the impression of flying in a submarine! on the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitors. the ife is ok the screen is large enough but the film selection is under average. the service is good food and beverage ok. to summarize as long as ba proposes (very) attractive fare (that was the case) i will fly again ba if not i will fly the competitors.",yes
no,london heathrow to zagreb return in economy. used the ba app to check in at both airports. both flights on time. i found the crew were friendly and got the job done. they appeared to enjoy their work. the flight back from zagreb was almost completely full - but the crew were good and ensured that everyone was catered for.,yes
no,lhr-mad club europe a320 seat 2a 15.25 hrs departure: newly refurbished cabin looked very classy in dark brown leather. crew was excellent was start to finish. however those new seats are a catastrophe. there is not enough leg room they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. that's in business class. it is just like easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. really? the flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? terrible disappointing experience. these new seats have to go and food must improve.,yes
no,"mia-lhr-bkk round trip club world three 777 and one 747. check-in wait time is short for all flights. fast pass through passport control and or security at heathrow and bangkok a big time-saver. priority boarding smooth and relatively fast. miami lounge shared with other airlines but excellent selection of comfortable seating food and drink. heathrow lounges food offerings lacking. small bangkok lounge serviceable but wi-fi was down. cabin service in general good with fairly attentive staff. i did however receive an unprofessional and snide comment about ordering a fourth kir royale on my last leg despite the fact that there were six hours left in the flight and i was not showing any signs of drunkenness. i did not pay $8500 to be insulted by cabin crew. food over the four flights was inconsistent ranging from tasty to inedible. ife showed the same movies on all four flights despite the fact that i flew in two different markets and my return was a full month after outbound flight. as i am only 5'3"" tall the seat was more than adequate though i could see how taller people would have a problem with it. also i find it ridiculous that you must pay to choose your seat more than 24 hours before flight. aisle seats are preferable as those on the inside must climb over the feet of the aisle passenger to get out into the aisle. good overall experience except for a few pointed gaffes. on the fence as to whether the price is worth it.",yes

no,lhr-vie in club europe on a320. plane was an ex-bmi aircraft so it still had the old seats which are wider than the refurbished aircraft. aircraft was clean and well-maintained. good amount of legroom in row 1. priority boarding honoured. cabin crew were friendly and helpful. seat was comfortable. on-board catering reasonably good with champagne offered. flight was on time. luggage delivered with priority. no ife offered. happy to fly with ba again if price remains competitive.,yes
no,just completed a return trip to hong kong on the a380 which is a magnificent aircraft. the crew food and inflight entertainment were good. we travelled economy and paid an extra £140 to reserve 2 seats on the upper deck. we found the seats uncomfortable and when the person in front reclined their seat you were trapped. leg room was restricted by the video box. we were sat 2 rows from the toilet which were nearly constantly in use and the noise from the toilet flush was an irritating. the inflight entertainment just kept me sane as i found it impossible to be comfortable.,no

no,"first time with ba (a code share flight for jal). travelled nrt-lhr and return (ba5/ba6) on b777 in cw. seats are designed in an s shape. this means that half the passengers fly backwards! seats lie flat but a foot rest has to released from the wall to put your feet/legs on. width of seats is poor and i found the seating cramped. service was excellent both ways food good with plenty of drinks and snacks on offer. very hard to get to storage bin to put your stuff into. one small gripe a 12 hour flight needs more than one meal and a light ""breakfast"". lounge in narita good standard but in heathrow very basic.",yes
no,travelled to and from india recently in club world. outbound to hyderabad and return from mumbai. outbound we had the 787 which is a nice plane to travel on when in club world. it was definitely helped by the fact that the cabin was only 40% full. i was surprised that they had only loaded one of the cold options as a main meal. not what you would expect from a full service airline. on the return from mumbai flew on a 777 which is showing its age. the crew were very distant and far from warm. the hot dish for breakfast (a frittata) was tasteless and given that this was the main meal for the flight (due to time of departure) was disappointing. i agree with previous reports that the more experienced crew are more distant and lacking in customer service when compared with the newer crew. based on my flying experience over the past few years i would prefer to fly with the mixed fleet crew. they are definitely more approachable. overall flights were fine and on time. the above demonstrates failures in service levels which once again confirms that all of the 'enhancements' being introduced by ba are going in one direction the wrong one!,yes
no,ba16 singapore to london. b777 world traveller cabin. one of the most comfortable economy class flights i have had despite the fact the seating was on the more cramped side. the ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. managed to sleep 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. compared to air france which is self service appreciated that ba crew does the water runs. one complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly. this is my new favorite airline to london and offers great value for money compared to singapore airlines.,yes
no,lhr to dxb on november 6 an overnight relatively short flight. departing at 9:45 pm. crew managed to serve dinner in record time leaving maximum hours for sleep. wine selection limited but of good quality. dinner was fine - interesting first of meze followed by a lamb that withstood the long transition from preparation to plate. an excellent experience in total.,no
no,lhr-lca in club europe. the first class lounge at t5 was fairly busy but we managed to get a table in the dining area for a late breakfast. my eggs benedict was a poor second to my friends self serve full english. we boarded straight away and magazines hot towels and menus were offered before push back. drinks and nuts were served before lunch. the crew serving the right hand aisle were excellent. band 4 meal consisting of a salad choice of 2 mains and cheese or dessert. my chicken supreme was excellent served with gnocchi. drinks refills always at hand. an excellent flight. well done ba.,yes
no,52b on upper deck to lax and 51b back from lax to lhr. food on flights is ok and you are best advised to order a veggie meal in advance if you don't eat meat. seats are better on the a380 in club than on other aircraft where they are not as new or comfy. ife is fine though not as extensive as emirates. i like that the announcements are kept to a minimum. the washroom on this side of the aircraft is huge - perfect for changing.,no
no,lhr – lax club world a380 return a week later lax-lhr on 773 in first. outbound left almost on time excellent considering a full large aircraft. food and drinks service speedy an improvement on a year ago when the a380 entered service and lunch took 3 hours start to end! opted for lower deck front row middle two seats -perfect for friends not so much for strangers. prefer lower deck on outbound due to the middle seats and high ceilings / wide aisles. feels very spacious. arrival at lax improved and staff were very pro active in splitting esta and non and passengers and getting people through as quickly as possible. return flight outstanding. first lounge not yet open however used business lounge and was quiet with excellent service. priority boarding and walked to seat. csm introduced himself and explained that only 8 out 14 seats booked (rarity on this route) and as such had two seats each! middle seats for dining and sleeping then moved back to windows for breakfast and landing. food and service very attentive – never a wait for anything had to start turning down drinks. washbags had not been loaded at heathrow and sleeping suit size not available but given club washbag and as a gesture the crew gave a bottle of grand siecle to take away – worth far more than a couple of wash bags! could not fault the three cabin crew serving landed on time and bags were at carousel before us. can't wait to fly first to singapore next year and compare the a380 service.,yes
no,i had a very poor experience with ba from jo'burg to london was cancelled. we were kept on the tarmac for four hours with very little information and eventually told there was a technical fault so we would not be flying for another 24 hours. i needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no ba phone i could use. passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do. we were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated. ba did not publicise the right of all passengers to eu compensation but i knew about this so did apply and receive the legally required amount promptly. all in all this was a hugely disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and i would no longer recommend ba.,no
no,flew mct to lhr on 1 nov 14. staff at muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user). catering on the flight was awful. food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. on arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. we flew out on oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.,no
no,lax/lhr. the flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at lax. there is no first class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal business/first facility shared by ba qantas and cathay pacific. two hours before my flight it was a zoo. rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. the food and beverages was to a very high standard. there was no separated boarding lines for first passengers. flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. a poached salmon starter was neither here or there. luke warm soup. a rather nice but not exceptional italian style chicken dish. all served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. wines were fine. turn down bed service reminded me of why i don't like the new ba first class seat. the silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. in bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. i am 6 4” tall and not overweight. it's very awkward and uncomfortable. ba in old first i am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. you get a thin duvet. this makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. i don't think i slept more than an hour in the whole flight. the tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. this fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. what amazes me in the competitive world that ba operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. they trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. mind you on the lax route the only alternative is aa – and they have little ideas on quality in first class. when i look at what sia emirates (the best in my view) and etihad offer ba do not come close. ba often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. in fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!,no
no,just flew to and from new york jfk with ba flight out was great modern plane comfy seats and cabin crew who seemed to enjoy their jobs. unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldn't be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. have flown long haul with virgin and cathay pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider ba in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!,no
no,ba 83 from lhr to lax first time on airbus a380-800. very comfortable quiet and smooth flight. the aircraft was exceptionally quiet on takeoff. food and service top notch. nice to have a free beer and wine with lunch. first time in lhr which i found to be a zoo but excellent duty free shopping. lax can also be a zoo but that's to be expected. ba flight crew very professional and courteous. would fly them again especially on the a380.,yes
no,lpt to lhr and back found the planes new and in good conditions fantastic crew always asking if we need something will fly again with ba for certain.,yes
no,london gatwick - barbados in premium economy. saturday during half term. gatwick airport very busy. check-in in business class counter and fast track very efficient with minimal waiting. ba lounge overcrowded but good breakfast options and plenty of champagne. priority boarding efficient. seat comfortable with lots of space and sufficient recline for a day flight. food from club world menu very tasty (fillet steak) child's meal very good. plenty of drinks rounds during the flight and staff very pleasant polite and helpful. entertaining system ok with reasonably good choice of films. flight one hour late which meant no queues in barbados. overall a very good flight with an incredibly good value for money (tickets were purchased during the ba sale). thoroughly recommended.,yes
no,lhr-zrh. a320 was used on this route. i was not expecting much since the flight was under 2 hours and i was not disappointed. despite a delay due to traffic at lhr and later around zrh the staff handled everything well and were still very warm and welcoming. there wasn't any ife so i can't rate that.,no
no,kingston - london gatwick in club world. check in and fast track very efficient without any delays. lounge surprisingly good comfortable with a reasonable selection of food and drinks inclusive of sushi rolls and bar service with cocktails and champagne. it must be on of the best lounges in west indies. priority boarding excellent. business class passengers are escorted to the gate. entering the plane and during the entire flight greeted and addressed by name. staff very efficient friendly and smiling - willing to assist during the entire overnight flight. relatively new plane with comfortable flat bed seats and a good entertainment system. good selection of movies. dinner and breakfast of a good standard and a great selection of spirits wine and champagne. child's meal very thoughtfully done. slept for 6 hours. flight on time and swift luggage delivery. high standard of service with excellent value for money.,yes
no,lhr-jnb 15/10. i cannot understand why ba have chosen the seating arrangement in club world on the new a380 with one seat facing forward and the seat next to you facing backwards so as to be facing your neighbour. food reasonable and service ok but not overly attentive. return flight in premium economy seats not as comfortable as in the 767.,yes
no,flew ba to munich. quick check-in good boarding sandwich wasn't the best 'evening meal' i have ever had but adequate on a short flight. good crew. exemplary crew on return flight. nice airbus with comfy leather seats. both flights on time/slightly early.,yes
no,worst experience from bangalore to heathrow - delayed and connecting flight from lhr to san diego was missed. they put us on a flight to chicago with seats in the middle of premium economy. we had booked bassinet seats on our missed flight. chicago to san diego on united - seats were not together. overall a pathetic experience. would never travel with ba.,yes
no,i flew from mia-lhr-dxb. the 747 like most of their crew is well passed its sell by date. the business cabin is tired and worn ife below standard seats are ok but nothing great. my biggest gripe were the crew on the second leg. we were in upper deck and found them quite inattentive and everything felt like a hassle but the best was to come. my wife and i had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. i pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. i was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after i complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink! the way they spoke to us was both condescending and humiliating and after all of this on clearly seeing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us another drink. as a seasoned traveler i have never been spoken to like this before. we flew american in business on the way to mia and in stark contrast the business cabin was excellent on the new 777-300 and the crew were only too happy to serve you. ba really need to have a look at themselves your crew by large seem to have an attitude problem see the paying passenger as an inconvenience rather they a valued customer. with such choice from dubai i will never travel ba again. if you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book ba otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesn't employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers.,no
no,flew lgw-ace-lhr. arrived at gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of ba ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the ba galleries lounge. i find that the ba lounge at gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! the flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin i proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. after take off the inflight service consisted of a hot english breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. the return flight to heathrow was also very good the lounge at alicante is typical of those in spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. all in all ba offer a good club europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of easyjet or ryanair.,no
no,london gatwick to tampa and return ba2167 and 2166. outbound flight departure was delayed for over an hour due to 'technical problems'. 90 minutes late arriving. in flight service to economy poor very few drinks people having to go to the galley to get water or juice. special meal on return awful and inedible. we ordered the same but got a different dish. didn't eat it. return flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger/ bag offload. entertainment system unreliable screen cutting out. check in staff in tampa told us we had no seats despite having printed boarding passes! turned out her computer was on the wrong day! they were good overall and lenient on baggage weight.,no
no,ba268 lax-lhr seat wt+ on the a380. check in was quick as was security and the oneworld lounge at tbi is pretty good although very crowded. boarding pretty quick on a packed flight. i found the crew seating and ptv to be consistent and very good. flight left more or less on time and landed 30 min early at t5 bags seemed to take ages coming off but a pretty good flight. i don't know what has happened to ba's food offering in wt+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.,no
no,travelled from gatwick to orlando on the 24th october with ba and i was very disappointed. for a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. we were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us as had the edible options of adult meals. the cabin was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. we had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry - had she not gone we wouldn't even of been aware that they were available. lesson learned - never fly ba again.,yes
no,lgw to cancun - flew with ba in cw. the galleries lounge at gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings! priority boarding was announced for those travelling in cw unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. the crew were friendly and offered a good service. ba's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. the so called cw pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. the inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. the return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. one member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. the meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. the breakfast served prior to landing at gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.,no
no,31.10.14 - lhr to berlin tegel. flight out good modern plane clean food ok and cabin crew good even pleasant. return 3.11.14 1625hrs from berlin horrid. crew only interested in themselves. was tossed a cup of coffee and a snack. staff openly ate the left over food from business class in the rear galley. i have complained about this before but clearly ba dont find it unpleasant. the return crew reminded me why i try to avoid ba.,yes
no,round-the-worldticket. jfk-lhr-txl on 28/29 july 2014. txl-lhr-man on 2 august 2014. all flights on time. great service from cabin crews. meals and drinks absolutely fine - no complaints at all. lovely lounge at txl small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge. check in at txl was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. nce-lhr on 30 august 2014. flight left late missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at lhr to dxb. lhr-dxb on 31 august 2014. ba ground service was exemplary. re- booked us on next day's flight. we had to stay overnight near lhr - refunded by ba. baggage did not reach us in dxb until day of departure (not ba's fault) but ba refunded costs of essential replacement clothing. flight was great ditto service from cabin crew. one member of ground crew at boarding was a bit 'short' with us but he had been given a rough time by a couple of recalcitrant y passengers trying to board with f and j passengers. overall very satisfied with ba.,no
no,sunday 2/11 dublin to heathrow. flight arrived late and departed even later due to the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took to board people. finally got to my seat to discover a young girl with two kids occupying it. shifted them out the way and continued. had to help this girl with the seat belt for the child as no one seemed to have explained to her what to do. flight was late so had to run out of terminal 5 which is no mean feat. if you are not in a rush use british airways otherwise pick another airline.,yes
no,bru-toronto-bru 1st class. in bru check in passport control (very long queues) security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. security in t5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. almost none. lounge in t5 a bliss in all respects. boarding ok although gate in t5b miles away. flight itself a disaster old tatty b747 in need of an urgent revamp. very used and ran down seats. cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. ran out of champagne. food not good at all. inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. bags not first out. return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which i took in case food was same disaster as flight in. not full cabin this time so a little better service although quality is still zero. again london t5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to bru.,no
no,terrible experience flying back from munich. flight delayed by several hours which meant arriving back into heathrow t5 at gone midnight after most of the public transport links had ceased running. nobody at ba available to help (despite them knowing the flight was several hours late arriving) which resulted in having to sleep at the airport floor overnight. appalled that ba would do this - it was an unpleasant experience but i coped but what about elderly travellers? to make matters worse there was nobody available as a ba representative at munich airport during the delay until i complained.,yes
no,ba2706 and ba2707 lgw-bcn. no real issues pleasant crew and flights on time but boeing 737-400 in both directions was clearly very old. rips in seats badly worn seat pockets very noisy aircraft particularly on landing not the most comfortable seats although leg room is good. would have preferred a choice of food rather than just a wrap as this is meant to be a premium airline. not a bad airline for short-haul really but i have had much better experiences this year with norwegian and easyjet both of which i will now choose over ba when possible until they heavily invest into their short-haul fleet.,no
no,ba 0027 ex london hr to hong kong which departed 30/9/14. hong kong to london sector on 17/9/14. inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. it was a relief to get onto cathay pacific flight for next stage of my journey. how can two airlines be so different? british airways is a disgrace.,no
no,we travelled economy from manchester to toronto via heathrow the flight from manchester to heathrow and return was very good. the seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. the service from the cabin crew was excellent. the leg from heathrow to toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. the seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. unfortunately ba were let down by the attendants on the return leg from toronto to heathrow. whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable i have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. we had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. the lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. the steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. he did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. even after take off she had to ask again. when they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. the steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. this had not appeared by the time i had finished eating my meal so i gave her the bottle from mine (my daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. the passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. i asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as i had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight). the attendant scowled at me and then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea (which was cold ) i did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey.,no
no,flight lgw to tfs in business. like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. one wants to like and use ba but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. unusually in my experience one of the fas was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too.,no
no,flew lgw - mco 26th october. was a bit worried about ba after a lot of mixed reviews. found the whole experience great. we were travelling with a 4 month old and the crew were faultless. so helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. food good - fresh and tasty. entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter! left and arrived on time - ba lounge gatwick fine but thought was a bit small. bought 2 return flights and baby seat for under £3k in ba sale so good on cost. well done ba and thank you.,yes
no,took ba flight 289 from lhr to phx 10/27/2014. very tired 747 with daily service to phx. entertainment system wasn't functioning. only offer was to move to one row from toilets and a complaint card to fill out. staff just going through the motions. no more ba for me and changing terminals is a nightmare in lhr and will avoid all costs.,no
no,went to bkk via heathrow on 26th october. was all excited to be flying back to thailand. i know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the uk flag carrier i was going to get a good flight. well to be honest i was disappointed - i was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. most other airlines have this facility in economy. no menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films i have seen before or had no interest in. even the documentaries were all bbc which were ok. music was equally lacklustre and limited. only saving grace was the seat i was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. sorry ba. i was expecting a good experience but felt let down and disappointed.,no
no,ba275/274 lhr to las vegas return in economy. both ways on 747-400 aircraft both times aircraft were tired and in need of updating/repairs. on the outbound flight bits of foam fillers hanging down on bulkhead wall. on return window blind broken/stuck. also on both aircraft the ife needed to be re-booted shortly after take-off and was very ancient compared to other airlines. both aircraft's were very warm before engine start. the outbound plane cooled down but the return remained uncomfortably warm - opening airvents had little effect. very rowdy passengers on outbound flight but no action taken by the crew other than to stop serving drinks to the whole cabin for a period. on return flight crew seemed in a hurry to complete dinner service - hardly allowing enough time to eat food before returning to collect trays. food was good on both flights. overall the flights were on time and the seats were comfortable (but difficult to get out of if the one in front was reclined). the service was functional but not particularly warm or friendly. it seems ba are either waiting to replace these 747's or have otherwise decided not to invest in the aircraft.,no
no,gatwick to marrakech and back. bag drop was fast gate was peaceful boarding on time and orderly all staff very pleasant refreshments good and landed on time. return almost identical just a little late landing after a technical delay taking off. well worth paying for a quality airline for a 3 hour flight.,yes
no,lax to lhr - 25 oct 2014. i agree with other reviewers that business class on the a380 is too crowded. i am a frequent business traveller to lax and if i had the choice i would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. the seats and small storage drawer (if you are on the aisle) feel cheap. service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner (1 instead of 2) and no attention to top up during the meal. my main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. the staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them). we flew first on the outbound to lax which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile. considering switching to virgin.,no
no,toronto to london heathrow - 26/10/14. after reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age i opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that ba has to offer. the outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats i think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. i arrived at pearson airport terminal 3 booked to return to london in world traveller plus. visited the premium plaza lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. boarding was really rather chaotic but i was delighted to be upgraded to business class at the gate! seat 3f was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which i find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. the drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. whilst i generally struggle to sleep on flights i found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. on time departure and arrival from gate c66 at t5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes. overall highly impressive from british airways would absolutely use club world again.,yes
no,"i have after years of loyalty finally had it with ba. every flight is late the catering gets worse and worse and the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. i have taken 5 flights in 2 months and every single sector has been late. even the crew in first class have no idea what ""service"" means - i have to ask for things 2 or 3 times i am not offered anything unless i ask the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which i could have played squash with) they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of lhr i cannot find any flights when i can use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade. they won't even allow my pa to deal my flights for me. it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become so far removed from their promise to fly to serve.",no
no,lhr-del. rtn club world. excellent service on both sectors and found that middle seats are good for companions. i found the rearward seating disconcerting but was otherwise comfortable. flight crews were excellent. i would agree with aisle passengers that they must find the need to reach across them at service times irritating.,no
no,flew ba from toronto to new delhi via london in premium economy class in august. first leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. premium economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). on board service was very good staff were great food was good. next leg from london to new delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. again staff and service were top notch. our return trip in october was made with our newborn baby. if anything the service was even better than on our first leg. thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the dreamliner. staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. again the food and beverage service was very good. the seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were ok not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. considering that i hadn't flown ba for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) i was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. yes being in premium economy helped but i was very satisfied comparing it to virgin atlantic's premium economy which i have regularly used. well done ba you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and i'm likely to fly ba again now.,no
no,round-trip iad-lhr in early october and it was one of the best trips i've taken. the seat may be the same size as on us carriers but it felt a lot larger. i was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle of wine with dinner which was a totally edible chicken casserole in one direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in the other direction. i was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though i had my own). us carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and i was delighted. service was the quickest most efficient i've ever seen on an airplane. loved the entertainment system. even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. this was about as painless as it could possibly have been. i will never fly an american carrier to europe again. i also got a good deal at a little over $700 as fall is a down season.,yes
no,arrived at gatwick to find out that our pre-paid for assigned seats could not be honoured due to an aircraft change. instead of three rows of seats a and b we were now slung across a single row with 4 middle seats and an aisle/window seat despite having requested and paid for the seat reservations 11 months ago. to make matters worse prem economy passengers had been bumped up to club world and were enjoying a/b seats - total joke. food was ok crew were friendly enough but i will never travel ba again due to the absolute neglect or consideration for their premium customers. goodbye ba executive club and good riddance ba. how the once mighty have fallen.,yes
no,flew from london to calgary. the seats in the new dreamliner are awful. it was bad enough sitting in the seat but when the person in front of me lowered his seat it became impossible. his seat was right on my legs that shows how little room there is on these planes. staff started serving meals all of a sudden went by about 7 or 8 rows of us and forgot to come back to feed us.,no
no,ba285 lhr-sfo seat 13a in wt+ on a pretty old 747-400 check in and security at t5 very quick i used the lounge at t5-b which was nice and close to the gate flight departed and arrived 1hr late. crew very good the seat ptv and food not the best on this flight. i've used ba a lot over the past 2 years and find them pretty consistent although i've also noticed that service along with seats ptv of course is much nicer on the newer a380s or the 777-300s so it's worth choosing your aircraft. otherwise ok flight.,yes
no,flight ba1445 edinburgh-london code share onto lisbon. first leg delayed one and a half hours in edinburgh with no explanation. arrived at heathrow and there was no operator available for the airbridge so sat on the plane for 15 minutes. traveled onto lisbon on a tap code share flight and find our luggage had been left at heathrow. an appalling example of customer service on every front.,no
no,flight 103 on october 14. we flew from london to calgary alberta - a long cramped ride. it was on the new dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything. when the coffee did come it was lukewarm. there was not one good thing about our flight. we will never travel british airways again.,yes
no,lhr-gru b744 first time with ba my experience was great. seat was very good and comfortable with many adjustments. great dining options good quality of snacks available throughout the flight. crew very nice. one thing i did not like was the layout making it difficult for people in the middle to have aisle access when seat were turned into beds. and staring directly into people's faces when the curtain between seats is down can be awkward. crew didn't care too much about safety issues like seat reclining and window blinds for takeoff and landing. entertainment was a bit disappointing screens were old and blurry not a big selection.,yes
no,"traveled with british airways ord-lhr last month world traveller on the way out and club world on the return. connected to dsm via american airlines and could see a marked difference in the level of service as well as the hard product. flew on a b777 both ways and was impressed with the amount of room both in economy and business. usb ports 1 in economy and 2 in business and large entertainment screens. the food in economy was better than i have had on domestic (us) first class and the pitch was comfortable for my 6'1"" frame. attentive cabin staff who made sure i was comfortable. drink service in club world was excellent a good rose cointreau and tanqueray. lie flat bed fairly comfortable and was able to sleep for 3-4 hours. due to changes in travel plans i had to pay a change ticket fee but even with that and the cost to upgrade to club world i felt that i got more than my money's worth. 1 free checked bag for world traveller and then 3 free with club world made navigating the airport a breeze. will fly british airways the next chance i get.",yes
no,travelled to palma in new ba 'sardine' business class. uncomfortable seats with ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. poor service. despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. other passengers also shocked at conditions. if this is the new look business class ba then better off with easyjet or ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse.,yes
no,gatwick to marrakech and back. bag drop was fast premium security slow (not bas fault). faultless calm boarding on time and a great flight with good service and refreshments. return flight bag drop even better departure a little late due to a technical problem the 737s are getting on a bit. again great inflight service and only a little late. bags arrived as we got to the belt. am very glad we chose ba for a 3 hour flight. really good.,no
no,we flew london heathrow to singapore business class for the first time with ba and was not impressed - the cabin crew did the bare minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get our head around it - thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight - we sat on the 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow - felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats as they had to face strangers on the take off and landing - we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with ba we would not wish to fly with them again.,no
no,gig-lhr b773 newly refurbished cabin. seats were good and comfortable food was reasonable and entertainment was great hd screen with many options.,yes
no,october 16th ibiza to london heathrow. well a great service as usual and we actually arrived on time for once 5 minutes ahead of schedule that is a miracle for london heathrow! the only thing about british airways is that they only do one drinks service i am sure two is far more appreciative as i know other scheduled airline services do more than one on a 2hr flight. tea/coffee only gets offered a poor once. but great flight all in all!,no
no,lhr-iad-lhr 29/9 and return 13/10. we booked our original flights on wtp on the a380 and b777 both fitted with the revamped world traveller plus - far more comfortable than the old style wtp with an infinitely better ife system. so guess how pleased i was when ba changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit b747's with the old style wtp. the 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with a380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. our b747 was filthy. the catering on the way out to washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. on the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. inedible and disgraceful. good grief ba can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? the good points: both flights were on time and the fa's were ok. that's it. this would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. this is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. no other major airline that i regularly use does this - not even small ones like bangkok airlines or united express. it is shameful - even our american friends who flew ba back to chicago were dumbfounded. you expect it on ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline. i recommend ba but with enormous reservations - try to book on the b777 or a380 and if you don't need to choose your seat before check in you'll be ok.,no
no,osl-lhr in business. ba has over the last few years put less priority on oslo and sas today has a better offering. ba is the only flag carrier in oslo that does not offer fast track security. the menzies ground staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong. particularly the evening flights are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from lhr and i have several times been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flights as a result. the de-icing procedure is also much slower than on sas. the lounge in oslo is nice but not magnificent. ba has better service in business class than sas with better food and free middle seat. you do however pay much more than for sas plus. the crew was friendly and did their best on my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to serve bread with the meal and spent a lot of time chatting in the galley. one sometimes miss the old well trained ba staff. sas also very often offer internet access on the london flights which is a plus.,no
no,heathrow to bergen business no priority boarding bus out to plane which was packed - a bad start. aircraft cold slow cabin service and in fact glad to get off. food was ok the cooked english breakfast was nice.,yes
no,"ba176 jfk to heathrow 13 october 2014. the outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse. how wrong i was. arrived at business check-in at jfk terminal 7. no staff at desk. boarding pass printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minutes to check luggage. agent was rude and unhelpful. onto the ba lounge. sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps. on asking the receptionist where the food was i was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility. asked when this opened and was told it was not operating. eventually some badly cut sandwiches and lumps of cheese with crackers appeared. no hot food was available. two hours before departure the flight was posted as four minutes late. no further information was posted. when i asked for an update thirty minutes before scheduled take-off i was told there would be an announcement shortly. eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane was now boarding. the departures board had not been updated so premium passengers were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin. onboard after presenting my boarding pass i was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane i was seated. on reflection late boarding may have been a blessing. i lost count of the times i was knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage. eventually the safety demonstration was played on the ife system. the sound was inaudible. surely a safety hazard. similarly all announcements from the cockpit went unheard. we took off one hour and fifteen minutes late with no explanation given for the delay. the wine selection was very limited on the flight as was the menu two choices of main course and only one dessert - i asked if i could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there was none on board. food was barely edible. service was poor. the cabin crew seemed intent on throwing trays round as fast as possible. my salad was served with desert (which i did not want) on the tray. the main course was overcooked beef near raw vegetables. i was made to feel a nuisance when i asked for a second glass of wine. the narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed. other carriers provide mattresses and duvets. ba seem to think a tacky blanket will do. the whole service has been downgraded to the standards i would expect in economy class. the nicieties that used to mark business flights have been lost in the pursuit of profit. given that ba charge far more that their competitors for this route i was thoroughly disappointed. i will not use any ba flight again if there is an alternative available.",no
no,very impressed with premium economy on ba sydney to heathrow and return. nice also to have an unsolicited upgrade to business on return singapore to sydney.,no
no,a319 barcelona to heathrow business no announcements for boarding so missed any chance of priority boarding. why pay extra for something you are not going to get! cabin service slow - over an hour until meal served had to ask for another drink as only 1 small bottle given. they also ran out of the main choice meal and the cabin was not full had second choice meal and this was cold. to fly to serve - i think not. terrible service for an airline that is supposed to pride itself on service.,yes
no,ba213 heathrow to boston 29/09/14 b747. there was nothing at all to commend this flight. i have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. the seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. the business lounge at heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. at 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. when staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. never once in two hours did i see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. on boarding i was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as i have been on other airlines. when i asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - i was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. again i have always had help on business flights on other airlines. in the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. the level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. add in poor food and ife and decision to avoid ba flights in future was made for me.,yes
no,i fly the pos to lgw route on a fairly regular basis and the punctuality of the flight is bad. i suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on this route. the air steward wasn't friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. the inflight entertainment needs updating. the screens are small and the resolution low. the seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket.,no
no,i recently flew on british airways long haul on a flight from philadelphia to new delhi havinh not having travelled with british airway for around a decade. i had been a huge fan of british airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. i also was curious to see heathrow's new terminal 5. british airway's overall product has improved in that time. on the first leg from philadelphia to london i was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new audio video on demand (avod) entertainment systems. i had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and i enjoyed their world music section in particular. the asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. my only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. in addition i found the chapatis on the delhi-london sector to be hard as rocks. otherwise the meals were very good. terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the london-philadelphia sector when i had the opportunity to fly on the dreamliner. the plane is a marvel. the windows are huge dimmable by button too. the bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. additionally the legroom on the dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the b777. and finally a word about the cabin attendants. their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of british hospitality - informal politeness. all in all i was happy with my ba trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.,no
no,lgw-agp and back. 737-400s on both journeys. these aircraft are looking very tatty now - seats worn cabins grimy and dingy. the 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. no choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. the claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. although we benefited from it on this trip ba need to change their hand luggage policy. there simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). on the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.,no
no,we have just flown economy class london to los angeles on the a380. outbound the meal was chicken which i do not eat so i was offered an almost inedible pasta dish. no more food was offered until 2 hours before landing chicken sandwiches i asked for a replacement cheese and chutney was offered. i was actually hungry by this time. return journey was chicken curry replaced by vegetarian lasagne. breakfast was awful a cardboard box containing a croissant jam cereal bar and a packet of dried cranberries. the service between meals was non existent. by far the worst airline food i have ever eaten. sorry no british airways for us.,yes
no,"aberdeen-heathrow-miami and return world traveller plus (premium economy). received a text from ba at 0600 that our 09:30 abz-lhr flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the us flight. phoned the helpline as suggested. utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday. made unsuitable suggestions including can you get to aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on phone to them). gave up and just went to the airport. fortunately ba staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections. flight to london was good with good service leather seats. cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and ba staff member met us to get us to next gate asap for miami flight. service centre useless but face to face staff great. lhr-mia flight. aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and wt+ seats were rubbish in comparison to virgin product that i have experienced. not that comfortable. seat back tv is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. staff were pretty good. aircraft on time. return journey much the same but staff were better. conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. but needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. if you take a ipad to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. their helpline needs to be addressed. clue being in the title - helpline. would fly ba again but would think about their wt+ option carefully.",yes
no,lhr-den den-lhr - always use upper class in va when i can. this flight reminded me of just why i rarely fly ba. most of the crew were disinterested. i raised a couple of points but i was told i was wrong both times. asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that i had even asked for one. food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful. i for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. you stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.,yes
no,i flew one way mco-lgw 6th october the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations british airways has lost a customer for life. i requested assistance due to illness which i couldn't have at orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? when boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because i was young and didn't appear to need assistance. after this i could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if i was ok. the drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. the meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. the 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. why do they need to be chilled? room temp would make them a bit better. the head rest was hanging off its housing when i boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. the ife screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both virgin and thomson on this route. when i got to gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance. never again ba.,no
no,first class flight from toronto on monday 6th october. the cabin crew were first class food was very good. smooth flight great takeoff and landing. would recommend flying with british airways.,no
no,"lgw to cmb via mle and return sept/oct 2014. as a british citizen you desperately want to like ba but they do make it very difficult to do so. the recent documentary ""a very british airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to ba particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. the only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",yes
no,flew from lgw to catania. lounge at gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the ba approved cafe next to the non schengen passport control. flights both ways were good and we liked the pilot pointing out lake geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. the return flight back to lgw the captain was hard to hear and wasn't so interesting. that aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming fas. the food was also good too and we landed on time. baggage came very quickly at lgw but at catania airport it was a bit of a carnival! i'm afraid catania airport is the worst airport i've been through but there you go! i think it is one of the joys of travelling.,yes
no,st lucia to london round trip. full flight both ways quite unhappy staff on return leg tiny seatback screens and poor selection of entertainment meals satisfactory (taste was ok and enough to fill me up both legs on time but was quite expensive for the service i got. would fly them again if they are the cheaper option.,yes
no,lhr-mxp-lhr 6th october. check-in/bag drop at lhr pretty slow again - used lounge t5 south which i always like. a320 out which appeared new - a full flight of around 1.5hrs with a sandwich and drink served. crew very nice and we arrived slightly early. return check-in quick and then a long walk to the lounge which was shared with 5 or 6 airlines - ok not much food but pretty quiet and nice place to wait for flight. a319 on return full again crew very nice the same sandwich and drinks served - arrived back at t5 on time no bags so out within 20 min.,yes
no,777-200 4-class refitted with the new world traveller and wt plus cabins. lhr-del-lhr. very disappointed. on the outbound flight the food choice was gone before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal - second choice for good reason. it was a truly unpleasant tray of food. the real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space i have ever seen. it literally takes up half of the floor and prevents you from stretching both legs out. i don't know if this is exclusive to the refitted b777's but it is certainly a side effect of the new ife and isn't there on the the older cabins. the box seems to be under every window seat on both sides of the cabin. i really don't understand what the cabin designers were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious. they could have at least rounded off the corners. it seems rushed and last minute. this means that i am now avoiding ba when booking a trip if they are operating the b777 on the desired route. bye bye executive club silver.,no
no,booked a seat in world traveller (ecomomy) for an extra €60 each way. this was to get an exit seat with legroom and a window. seat was advertised as window exit. yes it was an exit seat but there was no window at the seat. the slide / raft box protruded from the exit door greatly reducing the amount of space for legroom. seat beside me was empty but a guy was quickly moved into it when he asked for it despite us having to pay €60 each way for these seats. stewardesses were friendly but service was almost non existent. the child portion chicken dinner was in no way filling. was hungry throughout whole flight. no food or snacks offered until about 1.5 hours before landing when i was given a cheese roll with no butter or mayonnaise completely dry and unappetising.,no
no,"route: heathrow - toronto first class daytime flight. check-in / security: the former was smooth friendly and efficient. the latter was very poor on the basis that ba make no special provision for security with f class passengers either at their own hub (heathrow terminal 5) or any destination. f class passengers are not escorted which i consider to be a significant shortfall when clearing immigration and boarding flights. lounge: flagship lounge (concorde room) is quiet elegant reasonably well staffed and conveniently located after security. good food in civilised portions served in the restaurant and a good selection of wines. ife and amenities: the tv is fairly decent even on the refurbed 747s. comfortable seats / beds with decent bedding and pjs. good leg room which i notice at 6'2"". practical sized amenity kit which is fairly well stocked. food: decent food and well presented. selection is sufficient but no special options available pre-boarding. crew: generally affable crew who were professional. not the fastest of service in comparison to other f products. crew and captain introduced themselves to a number of passengers which sits between those airlines where all passengers are chatted with and those who don't. i would say ba have the right approach in that crew seem to visually assess whether a passenger looks like they would invite a social conversation - rather than imposing it anyway.",yes
no,ba038 pek to lhr 28-09-14 business class b747-400. first time i have flown ba long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site - i was keen to see for myself. i can honestly say i have never experienced such a dreadful flight. antiquated and filthy plane is an experience i would never want to make again. the seating in business class downstairs is a disgrace i was unlucky enough to have the aisle seat 17g which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and i am small was over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move. completely unacceptable. no mattress and only a small blanket. there is nowhere to put even a pair of glasses or a bottle of water once the tray table was put up (necessary to sleep). to get to the centre seats where my husband was - a dirty plastic ‘window’ had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space (what there was of it.) my husband said the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. extremely difficult for short people. the whole design of the business class seats is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed. the food was badly presented and unappetising. the pa system from the flight deck was inaudible i could not hear the captain in the pre flight information announcement the other issue was a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information was not available for the whole flight. they weren’t overly concerned just superficial apologies. the toilets were filthy and grimy. the floor edges and all around the basin area where bits were falling off were thick with dirty grease. i looked into the galley and that too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. total disgrace. the cabin crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat. very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. needless to say i will never travel ba long haul again. they need to get on to an emirates airline and see how it should be done. as a regular long-haul traveller on emirates the difference between these companies is indisputable. perhaps the so-called ‘loyal’ ba customers have never been on a emirates flight to compare the difference.,no
no,we flew ba from london to dulles dc 10/8/2014. unfortunately we were seated in economy so space was very tight but the staff could not have been anymore accommodating which greatly helped.,no
no,"b787. just returned from a london - toronto - london flight. ba appear to be proud of their new ""dreamliner"" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each row 3+3+3. the only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. we are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time i have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat - and i am quite slimly-built! unless ba changes their 787s to a less-cramped layout i will now have no alternative but to make sure i am not flying in a 787 thus often avoiding ba altogether. i will let a ba steward have the last word: ""the first time i sat in one of these seats i could not believe how bad they are"" - and he like me is slim. come on ba - start having a little regard for your customers' comfort and health.",no
no,i travelled to hong kong with british airways from heathrow on a 777-200 outbound and one of their new a380's on the way back both in world traveller. it had been a long time since i had travelled with ba (18 years!) but it was one of my better flying experiences. i didn't know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out. i was annoyed as i was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping although i had specifically asked for the window seat for a reason. however the crew were great and asked if i'd like to look out of the window by the jump seat which i did for a good few hours! not only that the crew called the flight crew and the co-pilot walked to the back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them! airlines don't have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers. the seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the ife had plenty of selection. the food was good not dried out and it was tasty. all the toilets were operational and were clean. on the way back i was upstairs on the a380. the aircraft was extremely clean comfortable and the a380 was ever so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me. i really loved the 'seat locker' next to my window seat which easily fitted the contents of my hand luggage. food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at heathrow. toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the ife was good. leg room was good. the only thing i would say is that the ife does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage cannot really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet.,no

no,"b787. just returned from a london - toronto - london flight. ba appear to be proud of their new ""dreamliner"" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each row 3+3+3. the only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. we are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time i have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat - and i am quite slimly-built! unless ba changes their 787s to a less-cramped layout i will now have no alternative but to make sure i am not flying in a 787 thus often avoiding ba altogether. i will let a ba steward have the last word: ""the first time i sat in one of these seats i could not believe how bad they are"" - and he like me is slim. come on ba - start having a little regard for your customers' comfort and health.",yes

no,vie to lhr - seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in club and economy. the seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. the new cabin looks very small with the new seats and i would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with ba now. the service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. i hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. ba short hall can now be classified as a low cost carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs.,no
no,"lgw to szg. absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. booked flights to salzburg for travel in september way back in april and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. luckily we arranged an overnight stop in gatwick as we live in the north of england as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. we were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at gatwick for 5am. this is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with ba. our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. having taken the trouble to complain to ba i am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". ba need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. i would not trust or travel with them again.",yes

no,ncl-lhr-lax / las-lhr-ncl. ncl-lhr a320. comfortable enough for only a 1hr flight. crew did a great job serving a full flight in such a short space of time. overhead bins were full and was a bit tricky finding space. some passengers had put very small bags overhead and not under seats and refused to take them down it did seem people have more carry-on than allowed. took off on time and arrived early but this meant no stand available for 15mins. lhr-lax on a380. paid to get two economy seats on the upper deck together and was worth the money as no stranger next to us no moving for loo breaks etc. aircraft excellent ife great (games were good moving maps etc also great) crew superb food was nice (first meal very good!) and the ice lollies were a great touch but did think an extra drinks service would have been good. we were close to a galley so easy enough to go and ask for drinks which we did two/three times. seat was good but equal space to the earlier a320. extra bin beside seat was useful. the arm rest doesn't go all the way up which was a bit of a pain. take off delayed by a fault on the airbridge but arrived on time - takes a while to get off due to number of people. las-lhr on a b747. older aircraft and compared to the brand new a380 it showed again paid to get two seats together which was worth it. seat ok but not as comfortable as previous flights food was ok ife was ok but my ptv was off centre so had to watch sideways. overall just an ok flight. crew were friendly and didn't hide away all night which normally happens on late flights with other carriers. my only problem was the arm rest didn't go up and when the seat in front of me reclined i couldn't get out. lhr-ncl on a a319. super quick flight not 100% full but crew again worked quickly to get everyone drinks and snacks. arrived 15min early but took a while for bags to come off at ncl.,yes
no,traveled to rome with british airways. on the way there everything went fine. a day before our departure we were told that the flight was overbooked and asked politely to change to a different flight. we were told that they would pay for the taxi (the flight was earlier and no public transport was available.) as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. we agreed to change because we sympathized with ba representative who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support british airways. big mistake. apparently everything we were told by their representative was a lie and no refund for the taxi fare was given to us. so much for doing ba a favor they are not a reputable company they once were.,no
no,ba26 22/6/2014. during my trip to the uk i feel very pleased that i chose ba. the a380 was superb. the new thales inflight entertainment was more than excellent. there were 1250 hours of on demand to choose from. although the food was quite limited i really liked the entertainment and the staff service. first class service in economy class!,no
no,flew from ist to lhr on september 29. in short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. it started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates. i have used the star alliance lounge at ataturk airport and it is light years ahead of the ba lounge. the plane was an ancient b767. the business class seats had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable. it took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. this was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began. there were only two choices nothing vegetarian. the crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive. the entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie godzilla which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. at the end of the flight we were given fast-track cards to speed up our passage through customs. unfortunately only 3 of the 6 fast-track booths were open and we ended up effectively in the slow-track line. to add insult to injury this business class flight cost $200 more than that of its competitor turkish airlines and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the ba website. shame on british airways for this product.,no
no,flew the new 787 business class from phi to lhr. the aircraft was impressive. it was quiet and comfortable. the lower altitude cabin and the higher humidity were not noticeable in flight but the lack of jetlag was noticeable. service was very good. the business cabin was 2/3 empty. the cabin crew were very attentive. the negatives was the seating and entertainment system. with the large windows the rear facing seats were a poor design. the feeling of closeness was uncomfortable. i guess the extra seat they squeeze in makes it all worth while to the airline. the amount of choices in all the video selection and the content left a lot to be desired. return was in a 777. the seating and entertainment were the same this and the a380 use to be my favorite airplane. however the 787 has become favorite airplane now. i think it is the last time i will fly ba business class until they change their seating.,no
no,singapore-london heathrow - i did not really see the ba hospitality. the entertainment was poor and the seat very uncomfortable. this experience makes me very frustrated the only good thing was the low price.,no
no,lhr to yvr. september 29 2014. i've been a loyal ba passenger for years but after three recent flights that's not going to be the case any more. how ba have the audacity to screen 'ba a very british airline' on their ife is beyond me! while the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. the food on ba85 lhr to yvr was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. the service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. ba used to have a good ife selection. not anymore! very unimaginative selection of films tv and audio programs. i've recently travelled on qantas and air canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to ba. air canada has significantly improved it's standards.,yes
no,"hannover - lhr. what a miserable experience this was. this return ticket was £950 for a total of about 140 mins flying time. i checked in online and there was considerable delays on this as there was following a phone call back to the uk an equipment change from an a319 to an a320. anyway i checked in online eventually and made my way through security. i asked an information post - as to where the club / business class lounge was and i was told it was land side and between ""this terminal and the next terminal"". i could not believe it. surely a simple prompt online when checking in - could have told me this. flight left on time a reasonable light lunch and three gin and tonics later we got stacked over the east end for 25 minutes but landed ""ahead of schedule"". a miserable experience from the so called ""world's favorite airline"".",yes
no,"flew from lgw to pfo and back recently. plane was old tatty 737 but at least we got the 34"" of legroom which the refitted planes no longer have. flights were on time both ways food was reasonably good & cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard flight). i was surprised to find ba no longer has a club lounge at paphos and even more surprised to find that there was a comfortable lounge there that ba club europe passengers were unable to use. we were given vouchers as compensation and thought we would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. the vouchers were of such low value they could only be redeemed for things like a local beer crisps and chewing gum. even though the flights were quite good i feel that ba are treating their club europe passengers with contempt by denying them any lounge access or reasonable compensation - also by refitting their aircraft to give passengers less seat width and the same legroom as economy. why pay a premium price for a non premium product?",yes
no,economy from lax to cpt via lhr. airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. both flights completely full. airbus quiet - on upper deck with a window seat. room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window as compensation. for a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and i prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the cpt leg. special meal not provided on last section of cpt leg - otherwise provided and edible. boarding easy at lax more chaotic with less waiting area space at heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. and transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible. otherwise flights on time at both destinations despite leaving late. heathrow is the main drawback when using ba and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it easier when planning the new terminal. lax was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.,yes
no,ba 084. yvr to lhr on august 28 2014. premium economy. much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on ba. staff were indifferent and inattentive. the meals were deplorable! despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. hardly suitable food for a long flight. breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. very poor! a number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the much-advertised additional leg room useless. ife far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. a very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost.,yes
no,lhr to amman jordan airbus 321. outward flight delayed 2 hours due to unloading a bag and technical problems on the ground. flight completely full upgraded to club world. cabin crew there excellent and attentive. seat comfort was ok but not special. food was good. one very small toilet next to the pilot door for club world passengers. terminal 1 on its last legs but check in was quick. return trip was in economy-what a difference!,yes
no,lhr-fco. flew out club europe courtesy of a reduced fare by ba. we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. the lounge in the satellite was more relaxed than the main t5 terminal. as it was an early flight the food was fresh pastries and small bacon baguettes which were excellent. nice way to start a journey. the flight was good. very attentive staff on the b767. my colleagues had recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown club before and were very complimentary about the experience. the return was economy on a new a320. impressed with the new style seats and again was a good experience.,no
no,"flew ba055 lhr to jnb on the new a380. what an absolute pleasure that was. had seat 50h which was at front on top deck. the cabin was nicely laid out i have to say i like the ba ""cocoons"" i know a lot of people do not but gave me plenty of privacy. the staff were extremely friendly and attentive with high quality food and excellent champagnes and wines. i would fly this plane again over any other. what was also amazing was a toilet that was not a rabbit hutch. flew back on ba056 3 weeks later. same seat only to find that the seat function did not work new plane and breaking already! not a major problem as stewards moved the seat manually for me. the quality of the food and beverages was up to the same high standard as when i flew out. movie choices were excellent and the quality of the new screens way above those on the older 747's and 777's. i managed to get good sleep on both legs at least 7 hours.",yes
no,flew earlier this month lhr to ist in club europe. good smooth uneventful trip. good lounge at terminal 5. food and service onboard was very good. priority boarding and priority pass for immigration in turkey. however it is difficult to categorise the seating and space with business class. in fact the amount of room available seemed little different to economy.,yes
no,airbus 321 from amman jordan to london. flight on time. full plane. very uncomfortable seats i am tall no leg room knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. this is the wrong plane for this trip-narrow single aisle only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers - more like a bucket and spade flight. food very moderate salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber main course of chicken and potato was tepid not hot at all. cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane although the food service was quick. upgraded on the outward trip-what a difference! ba needs to sort the plane choice out-this flight is often completely full. economy was very poor.,no
no,"lhr-jnb (south africa). booking done from site www.britishairways.com and the check-in too. the time boarding was done with great quality in terminal 5 in heathrow airport (pier c gate 65) and schedule. cabin crew was fantastic. the flight was very good the quality of the plane provides an excellent trip. takeoff and landing very smooth. the ""rest position"" of the seats makes in upper deck the legroom a little tight. do not choose the emergency exit seats because they do not have access to windows and are narrower because the table and the monitor are on the armrest. jnb-lhr. 747-400. it is a much older plane. however the trip was very good after crossing the storm just outside johannesburg.",yes
no,"lgw to alicante out on 8th september early flight. i was disappointed that due to ba changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that i booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. the seat allocated on the boeing was quite cramped for my frame and i was not that comfortable. i had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all i got was a request to phone ba after the flight. there must have been other passengers affected in this change. that said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. staff attentive and pleasant. the return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as i had requested. the snack was fine and the small bottle of pinotage was pleasant enough. due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. i think that ba needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like easyjet and ryanair seem to be able to do. however by booking early i got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so i can't complain. i also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines. i do like to ""fly the flag"" and shall continue to do so but a bit of investment in new planes would be nice.",yes
no,vie-lhr-lis on sep 18 both legs on an airbus 320 in club europe (business class) both legs on time or almost on time with an excellent crew (as most times with ba). transfer procedures in lhr terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at lhr (even intra-eu) were hassle free and easy. the scheduled layover was a rather long 3 hours. bas galleries lounge in lhr t3 was also comfortable with excellent drink selection and quite good food selection. i fly the vie-lis route regularly and surprisingly transferring at lhr is superior to most alternatives on the vie-lis route (especially to the more common alternatives fra cdg and even ams and bru) with the possible exception of zrh so taking ba via lhr is a really good alternative if the direct tp flight is not an option for whatever reason. the only negative i have to say that both flights featured the new ba slim seats which are really a huge step back in comfort compared to the old seating. seats in club europe are economy seats with limited seat pitch and the middle seat left empty. its just like flying with star alliance with their uncomfortable recaro slim seats. catering on the vie-lhr was afternoon tea which is bas weakest club europe service with bland sandwiches and acceptable scones. even their chicken tikka sandwiches in economy are better but they have full bar service and brilliant attentive fa’s so i believe ba is still one of best options to fly within europe. catering on the second leg was a good prawn salad (or a chicken dish). however my luggage did not make it to lis that day which was an unwelcome and unexpected surprise after the long layover in heathrow. but the issue was handled well fast and friendly by groundforce the company who does the luggage handling for ba in lis and i received my luggage without any further hassles the next morning. not a perfect score due ba’s new seating the delayed luggage and the vie-lhr catering but still pretty good service. as a side note vie airport is getting worse and worse. long lines at security with only two of the available four lines open. ba uses a shared lounge in vie which was overcrowded with basically not a seat available to sit down and limited food service. but at least ba uses the old terminal which is still far superior to the new skylink terminal used by star alliance which really is a show piece how not to design a new terminal.,yes
no,gatwick-colombo via maldives 10/09 return 22/09 club world. 777-200 3 class flight seats good as usual inflight meal ok. i really would be happier with a selection of starters and no main course. crew worked really hard as there were a few demanding passengers! full london-male-london just a handful of us continuing to colombo not surprised ba are stopping the colombo service from 28 march 2015.,yes
no,tel aviv to glasgow via heathrow. club world on ex bmi a321 so a different seat to the usual ba club world product. overall an excellent flight and service all round. the crew in club world were a real credit to ba and could not do enough for you. catering was excellent the seat was very comfortable in all positions and the airport experience at all ends was quick and easy. overall an excellent premium product made even more special by the cabin crew.,yes
no,"jfk to lhr - despite the image the ba tv show conveyed the galleries lounges at jkf is the worst run of all the ba lounges i have visited. i have had more polite service at macdonalds than at the desk in the galleries. there was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. the spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be of service today"" was more than disappointing especially given the £6k ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. how can ba get it so right offering 1st class service in london miami boston seattle hong kong and sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in jfk. boarding was a mess. they were boarding a qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. we asked a ba member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! first and business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. we ask ""why"" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"". upstairs on the 747 in club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment ba at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at jfk no surprise. heathrow ground services were smooth and our bags arrived in no time at all. i will fly ba clubworld again but not to jkf i will use virgin who offer better ground services at jfk which match the price of the ticket and they value their customer more.",yes
no,rome to london gatwick. delayed take-off from rome largely because the plane was held on the runway for nearly 30 mins. cabin clean and in good condition. staff attentive and professional. seats adequate for short journey but legroom is not generous. food ans drink welcome but the food poor and unnecessary on relatively short journey. ba could save money by limiting to beverages.,no
no,lhr-hannover germany. you really wonder sometimes with ba. i paid £940 return and what a joke. (last year i flew stuttgart and berlin in club for about££600 and was very happy). firstly the flight ran from t1 at lhr. t5 club lounge is rather good. on first sight the t1 lounge looked ok. i arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. with a bit of grovelling i managed to get a plate of singapore chicken curry from the waitress. the whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwich's peanuts and a miserable looking soup. drinks ok. flight was an a319 which left about 40 minutes late. couldn't be bothered to eat the prawn salad - which actually looked ok. fa's were fine. in summary a real big ba con. flight was one hour and at £450+ per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in first to jfk. a miserable experience.,yes

no,we flew on the a380 from heathrow to jo'burg return economy class. i thought the flight was excellent. the crew were very helpful and the meals were good. we flew in the bottom level one way but the upper level on the return - i liked the upper level better. there are convenient storage units by the window seats. keep in mind the overhead compartments are smaller upstairs though. would definitely fly with them again.,no
no,lhr to phl on 787 online check in worked well t5 first class lounge very nice good choice of drinks available food could be better but nothing to complain about. priority boarding worked well too. service always very good (flying every month to the us). did not eat anything because i wanted only to sleep. had seat 3e (middle seat at the end of the first club world cabin) which gives you a lot of private space. entertainment system good but a better selection necessary. overall i can recommend ba however on most of the asian airlines you have roomier seats.,yes
no,bhd-lhr. i flew ba from belfast george best airport to london the flight was very good and on time and uneventful. the crew was excellent and the aircraft was a new a319. the fare was ok.,yes
no,considering our outbound flight to orlando was delayed a good 2 hours i'm not sure why i expected better service from ba coming home. over a day before our return flight was due there was already a delay posted bumping our flight up a whole three hours. the next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening! we booked our flight to leave saturday so we would arrive home on sunday and be able to go back to work for the monday. but thanks to the reliability of british airways not only had we paid for two - now immensely - overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs! absolutely disgusting show from ba i honestly wouldn't even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business! i won't be recommending ba in fact i will actively encourage everyone i meet to avoid their awful business at all costs!,no
no,lhr-sin in economy. very relaxed and prompt check in at t5. a good attentive and humorous cabin crew nice wine dinner enjoyable the same poor breakfast as 20 years ago. very clean and tidy interior on 777. punctual and it goes without saying that the flight crew are excellent and you feel safe. will definitely seek to use again.,yes
no,flew heathrow - madrid return. have always been loyal to ba but no longer. t5 lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. bags not tagged priority. fast track not fast. service on board to madrid was exceptionally good and old style ba. return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. very disappointing experience and unacceptable. could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. waste of time and energy. practically everything suggested as part of the club europe package didn't happen. club europe used to be so distinctive and worth and i always felt it was worth the premium price. to be honest i have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which i will now be using for my regular flights to and from spain.,yes
no,flew lhr-bud 11 sep ba866 and return 15 sep ba 869 club europe. early morning flight from t3 so breakfast in lounge. usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). as is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. plane had been refitted with the new layout. beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in club. big disappointment. it feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. coffee still poor however. no ife apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. bud airport a disaster. no time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. no aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. very uncomfortable and unpleasant. on return the lounge ba shares at bud is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. a short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. priority boarding worked well. same plane configuration on return. excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. fas free with the booze and nuts. food was again a surprise - i had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. very tasty. ba can be hit and miss but i thoroughly enjoyed both flights. a great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.,yes
no,used ba for a return trip to denver and was very disappointed. plane was old and tired cabin crew did the minimum required and food was basic. had flown emirates the previous month and ba cannot hold a candle to them from the warm towels wide seats great entertainment and shiny new planes. wont be looking to support ba again.,no
no,orlando florida (mco) - london gatwick (lgw). wed aug 27 return sun sep 7. we paid over 150 dollars more for our seats and didn't even get a choice of what we wanted for our meal. in addition the inflight entertainment didn't work on our return trip.,yes
no,lhr-lis in club europe (on avios). easy check-in and security. ba lounge reasonable - good selection of drinks food slightly stale looking but tasty enough. bus out to plane. nice welcome in club europe cabin on brand new a320. seats comfortable albeit less legroom than expected. food excellent served by very attentive cabin crew. good updates from pilot. very good flight overall.,no
no,flew between lhr and jfk and the return leg was iad to lhr and onward to kul on mh. i must say ba has an excellent product offering. the crew are extremely friendly and are attentive. they are kept busy the entire flight with juice and water being served consistently. the only setback is that their b747 have seen better days and is in dire need of a refurbishment. food was good but the ife could be improved further with enhanced audio and video selection. i will surely fly with ba again. to the crew keep up the good work.,no
no,"if there is an alernative i will never fly ba again. i used to travel ba and it was wonderful now it is like an ""old"" airline. i flew from seattle to london this summer on a 747 the leg room was not the best the plane looked tired and i was not impressed. i am disabled so it is difficult for me to travel anyway. when we went back to heathrow i asked for help to get to my gate and i was put in a ""pen"" with other disabled people waiting for our flights. no one told us that they do not send you down until your flight is getting due to leave. in that time we could have gone and had a meal. my flight back to seattle was on a b777. the aisles were narrow and the seats very narrow. i am only 5'3"" but my knees touched the seat in front of me. it was very difficult for the people in the window and middle seats to get over me i had to get up out into the aisle for them to get out. being disabled to be up and down is hard especially in such a small space to manoeuvre ones legs. when people in front reclined it was awful. the food that was served was absolutely rubbish. what happened to the good ba service of a few years ago. no more ba for me if i can help it.",yes
no,my british airways experience lhr to paris cdg was excellent. i was travelling with an infant. the staff at lhr were so helpful and kind and went out of their way to help me. however it was a very different story on the way back. everyone in paris cdg was so rude. ba made me check-in my pushchair which meant i had to carry a 14month old boy (15kg) to the gate. it made my trip impossible. i pleaded with the man at check-in. there was no pre- boarding with infants. i will be taking the eurostar never flying again especially not to paris.,yes
no,economy from jo'burg to lax via heathrow. both flights on a380 and both full. comfortable flights on time and great service on the planes. main problem is at heathrow. at jo'burg excellent arrangements for boarding the flight - at heathrow insufficient space and just chaotic. if jo'burg can get it right surely ba can get it right at its premium hub - heathrow? and when arriving at heathrow the entrance to section c - where we landed - was closed so we were unable to transfer direct to the gates. instead we had to take the transit to section a go through the long lines of security there and then go back to section c. no one from ba or baa at the c gates to explain and when raised by ba customer service staff they were uninterested and as usual blamed baa rather than taking responsibility. shame as the service in the air and at other airports is usually very good.,yes
no,lhr-hkg on the new a380 in premium economy and it was a great trip staff were friendly and the food was very good for a gluten free meal. the only thing that i think they could improve on which cathay has is the dedicated check in and boarding for there flights other than that it was an enjoyable trip.,no
no,i recently travelled with a friend to st lucia and have to say that ba has once again surpassed my expectations. my travelling companion and i had booked world traveller plus and we were delighted to be upgraded to club class. the cabin crew were polite and attentive without being intrusive. we were also upgraded on our return and once again the high standards set on the initial journey were matched.,yes
no,lgw-mco-sea-lhr. seats booked during club world sale window - so reasonable priced. check in at gatwick very easy and through the fast track in about 5 mins. boarded on time with short wait before take off. staff on the outbound leg superb attentive without being intrusive food as ever palatable and overall great trip. inbound seattle - heathrow. lounge at seattle is simply too small with insufficient seating however once on plane staff were again excellent although they appeared little rushed when compared with the outbound leg that may simply be because the cw cabin was more full. that said the high standards were maintained so a credit to the team in the cw cabin. overall another good experience when travelling with ba.,no
no,i have flown lhr-bkk many times with eva emirates oman and qatar. unfortunately this time i chose my national carrier. disappointed is not the word. to start with the seating arrangement is absurd. all the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. ba manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. when the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. food - ok there was a selection on the menu. however at service time i was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. on every qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. none of this with ba. once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. shabby is not the word. after a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. with no sign of a priority immigration pass being given i asked the steward for one. he replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. stupidly i believed him. upon departure at bkk no ground staff or passes. i return to the uk next week and for the first time ever i am dreading the experience. never ever will i fly my national carrier again. disgraceful. it's any middle east airline again for me. qatar being my preferred choice.,no
no,lba-lhr. checked in on-line and boarding pass on my phone so no need to encounter check-in. fast track was average track and the lounge was busy with people going to the sunnier climes having paid for access. food selection poor. hot food limited to a self-toasted teacake. gate near the lounge and quick boarding. we were in 01d and e but the friendly purser said 01f was free so we had the front row to ourselves. early departure and swift climb. service was excellent. the purser addressed us by name offered us (several) drinks and a choice of snacks (crisps nuts or biscuits) (twice) on this short flight.,yes
no,flew syd-sin and had a reasonably comfortable trip. problem is i didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. everyone rather terse i thought and not helpful. not my favourite to fly. the aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.,yes
no,madrid-london on 9 september on boeing 767 aircraft. no queue at check-in and welcoming polite and efficient agent. priority tag applied to suitcase. lounge experience at barajas terminal 4 was generally positive. plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. my main gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability to monitor hand luggage (i saw several cases that were larger than the bag i checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). i was in seat 27a which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered. arrived at terminal 5b. bags arrived with minimal (less than 5 minute wait). overall a decent experience - i will continue to fly with ba provided seats are available at a good price.,yes
no,9/8/14 lhr-ewr in wc. clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. we find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid ba when possible. one fa spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. dinner was fairly horrid (beef) except for salad and cheese. late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given.,no
no,flew london city to malaga return 28th august and 8th september respectively. both flights on time on the wonderful little embraer 190 such a nice plane to fly in only two seats either side of aisle loads of leg room and large windows. full meal service in both directions with cooked breakfast on the morning flight out and good choice of rice or noodle salads on return lunchtime flight which is a huge improvement on the awful sandwiches they used to serve. return flight made even better by superb approach over london down the thames on a beautiful sunny afternoon - would pay good money for that part alone! full marks for everything except had to score one for 'inflight entertainment' as there isn't any on this short flight and wouldn't really expect it.,no
no,lhr-edi used avios to make short break to edinburgh. unlike transatlantic flights there were plenty of seats on offer even at short notice and we managed to get onto the flights we wanted. both flights were on time (more or less) and both were on new a320 aircraft - bright and airy interiors with plenty of storage space for luggage. the drink and small bag of nuts while welcome is nothing to get excited about and seems more of a gimmick these days to distance ba from its budget airline rivals. service levels both on the plane and on the ground were excellent throughout and i really enjoyed this domestic service.,no
no,flew vie to lhr club europe fantastic crew looking after the club europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped club europe cabin. i really do not believe what ba is saying that this is what their european passengers want! the seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the charter airlines seat pitch years ago. if the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. i really am not able to justify paying the club europe fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat i have ever say in. a number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by ba. british airways used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares ba really need to think seriously about the club europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.,yes
no,first and last time flying with ba upgraded the 4 of us to premium economy at £199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. have done this with virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. none of us could eat the food it was so bad. on a 9 hour flight we were hungry. don't waste your money upgrading i wish i had read reviews before i left.,no
no,lhr - ist. t5 efficient as usual no queues at check in or security. proceeded to the lounge where we relaxed and watched planes take off with glass of champagne. boarded on time cabin crew friendly food was excellent and of course more champagne! the only thing that ba need to do (which i believe they are). is to retire these old aircraft. the overall product is excellent but i think the cabin crew are let down by the ageing planes. (ife not personal to you etc).,no
no,just came back this morning on a flight from dubai - ba106. i was not impressed. the cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. the plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. it look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. ba was so particular before what's happened? the cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. the food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. i have to ask for water a number of times. there was no genuine warmth. it was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. i'd love to fly ba and support them but this is appalling. i would not recommended this - next time we are flying eremites. pay the extra. btw i noticed a number of other people have complained about this crew on the site too - seems consistently bad.,yes
no,flew heathrow to lyon return. late flight on the way out but made up all but 10 mins of the time. catering hardly worth the effort as comprised unappetising looking sandwich and one drink (not even tea or coffee on the outbound). crew good and check in very good especially at heathrow.,no
no,"lhr-mct-lhr. excellent outbound flight. tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice. different story on the way back though. stand-offish cabin crew and no white champagne. rose only as ""we haven't been fully catered"". not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod ba can sometimes be these days. the seat is comfortable so i slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink.",yes
no,travelled yyz-lhr-arn and return in mid august. check in at pearson was a bit delayed (only one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). premium economy cabin inside the boeing 787 (dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from toronto to london was very comfortable. transfer at lhr t5 takes time is something i learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. we missed our connection to arn (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. the fact that you go through security again in lhr takes some time as well. on my way back to toronto check in at stockholm's arlanda airport was easy and very smooth. the flight to lhr went fine and i had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. this is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. after a train ride to the c gates and a fairly smooth boarding i was onboard the flight to toronto. i had been upgraded to business class which was pleasant. service onboard was professional and courteous. landing in toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from heathrow. my overall w ba was good. however transfer in lhr is probably one of the more lengthier ones in europe i think. i preferred the short transfer at kef on my last trip to sweden a few months ago.,no
no,flew ba 215 lhr-bos in economy on an ageing 747. flight was 45 minutes late taking off. seat was uncomfortable and cramped.meal served was overcooked slop. ife had glitches but worked eventually. overhead light didn't work. the larger people become and they are the less space ba seems to give anyone. the plus point was the politeness and professionalism of the cabin staff.,yes
no,travelled lhr to montreal 21st august 2014 and montreal to lhr 1st september 2014. aircraft used was a 777-200 with 4 classes. this sector does not normally offer a first service so business class passengers were spread throughout the first and club world cabins. all flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. the lounges at terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. food choice was limited although i did enjoy the hot soup. seating in ba is dated and even ba's new first class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as emirates or qatar. food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. i know ba is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. i guess there is little competition for ba on the north atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the far east and australia are diminishing.,no
no,booked a british airways holiday so that's flight and hotel from london city airport to florence peretola airport. either it came up from the ba rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to business class and was told that would be an extra £300 for the return trip. as it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. reasons why no-one should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight. 1) no separate ba lounge at either london city or peretola airports. 2) faster boarding? entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at florence. 3) bigger seats and more leg room? they are small planes so the same throughout. 4) luggage off first? no point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at florence. 5) better meal? yes choice of meat or fish. very nice but worth £75 each? the ba rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest a hotel upgrade instead. it was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra £300 for no reason whatsoever.,no
no,when will they learn. i flew ba to dubai last friday in business. let me sum it up. boring food surly crew dirty plane and expensive. can the product get any more unimaginative. the inflight entertainment was out of touch with modern media the screen so poor i couldn't see the movie and gave up. the sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that i think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty. coffee was spilt on all the wipeable areas around my seat. in business you expect better. it is just not an enjoyable or fun experience by any means and they never upgrade you or take care of their frequent flyers. when i can i chose a different airline.,yes
no,"we flew ba gatwick to grenada - first time with ba and only due to dates having been dedicated virgin customers. we upgraded to ""premium economy"" and apart from the extra leg room (ideal for hubby but no odds to me at 5'3""). no benefit and total waste of money at almost double cost of upgrading with virgin! service was not great and food was awful - ""welcome on board"" drink in premium economy was orange juice in round plastic carton. virgin offers orange juice or champagne in a glass. no idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled ""chicken or beef"" response when asked stewardess. old and tatty plane very small tvs. first and last time flying with ba - will change dates of holiday in future to ensure virgin flight. overall this over-priced upgrade didn't even compare with virgin's economy service. i would strongly recommend don't waste your money or better still go with virgin.",no
no,we flew indirect to orlando and back - although the miami/orlando orlando/dallas and dallas/london flights were with american airlines (ba partners). the ba flight ba0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. having only flown virgin and singapore long haul ba rated way behind in all aspects. but that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with american airlines from dallas to london (ba 1531). i understand they are upgrading their fleet and i can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. the first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. the inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. the crew were the unfriendliest i have ever encountered - no meet and greet or goodbyes. i thought booking through ba would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not. the worst flight ever (we are a family of five) and i will not be flying ba again.,no
no,lhr-phl on a 787 dreamliner seat 3k. i recommend seats 3k 3a 7a and 7k as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. the seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. the service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. the food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. the entertainment system is excellent as it's the thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. the aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.,yes
no,"travelled with ba from rome to lhr. staff at rome were wonderful what a contrast to heathrow. entirely through my own fault i left my passport on the plane. when i asked for assistance three members of staff at the ""helpdesk"" did anything but help. in itself this may not seem terrible having got myself into this situation but when they did finally deign to speak to me they told me the plane had left. i pointed out that the plane was still outside the terminal building. their response was to ignore me. i finally found one very polite helpful well informed and kind person who did help. he was a trolley collector!",no
no,"london to budapest on club world-now i don't even mention the fact that my luggage hasn't arrived but the price for club world is a huge rip off! you can sit in the new ""slimline"" type of seat-which is thinner than the previous ones and some genius obviously thought that if they put in thinner seats why not squeeze in another 2 extra rows which means that the leg space is less than half as it was in the old days - so exactly like in economy class. so you pay 300 dollars more for 3 stale finger sandwich and a scone - what a bargain! shame on you ba for the lousy service. will never fly with them again.",yes
no,we flew premium economy on ba from boston to london then london to johannesburg. the seats were comfortable and the leg room was ample enough even for an over 6 feet passenger. the flight attendants were very attentive. having flown air france premium economy in september 2013 i must say that the ba premium economy is much better than that in the french airline. it was really worth the extra money.,no
no,this was the first long-haul flight i'd taken for 20 years and i had high hopes that our london-cape town flight would be far more comfortable and pleasant than the budget carriers we've used for european trips. boy was i wrong - we were squeezed in so tightly it was almost impossible to get out without injuring the poor person in the aisle seat and when the person in front reclined her seat my daughter could hardly move - we had to ask a flight attendant to make the person put their seat upright so that we could eat our meals. even worse - i actually paid extra to choose our seats in advance thinking that a window and centre seat wouldn't be so bad. come on british airways - i know that at the moment they are the only airline offering a direct lhr-cape town service but they can do better than that.,yes
no,economy class on 28 aug from london (lhr) to new york (jfk). boarding was in terminal 5 which i love as i can sit gatwick - orlando - gatwick. club world both ways. b777-200. worth the money every penny of it. crew on the outbound sector were fairly young and were a little rude seemed like everything was a chore. if you asked for something they hadn't got on the cart you couldn't have it. polite enough but not really interested in the passengers. crew inbound not being disrespectful but they were older and much nicer. nothing was too much bother. if they hadn't got it there and then they got it right away for you. lie-flat beds comfortable enough and baggage allowance of 3 bags per passenger is great for the shopping. food and drinks are good however i do think the food on thomson airways in premium is better than ba club world. in form of scheduled carriers british airways are ten times better than virgin in so many ways and would fly with ba again no questions asked.,no
no,i'm regularly flying perth-hong kong-london-port of spain these days. perth to london is via cathay pacific business class which is excellent. sadly i then have to swap to ba for london to trinidad where 'club world' is a euphemism for 'slum in the sky'. cathay pacific business class seats - 4 across the width of the aircraft. ba club slum - 8 across. if you're on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. decor is abysmal service is average to poor. seat and personal space design is lousy - but there's not much space to work with. film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines tvs of the 80s. the overall impression is a dreary coffin-like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service. don't do it! fly with someone else - anyone else!,no
no,"i have flown twice with ba now in business class (to and from delhi) and i have to say it has been absolutely poor! me and a few colleagues flew out to new delhi for a business trip. ba were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create the concorde. key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. allow me to explain: the blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a tft which had the same image quality as vhs tape! the decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film airplane! you still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. the plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. the toilets are exactly the same as economy except in business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. the food was ok but again nothing special. normally its the little things that make the differences but with ba they need a total make over. for a flight that happens everyday from london to delhi ba should be doing more. the decor of the plane matched the experience i got with ba dull. i won't be flying long haul with them again. my advice - avoid ba and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you.",yes
no,flew from london to doha on a newly refurbished 777. smooth ride through airport and pleasant staff on hand to help. boarding was on time but there was a slight delay which put us back by half an hour and delayed take off. captain was good at keeping us informed. cabin crew friendly enough but seemed tired in their service and no smile. food was average and not anything to write home about. i felt i had to eat quickly as the flight attendant was waiting for me to finish my last bite with a stern look! inflight entertainment was excellent and kept me entertained throughout the six hours you have got an array of movies tv games and music to choose from. seats were really comfy and i got a good kip. overall an enjoyable experience and i would definitely fly ba again.,no
no,atl to lhr: boeing 777 (economy). i've just returned from a family holiday in the usa and flew ba economy. the flight was slightly delayed but most of this delay was made up during the journey. staff were pleasant and the ife was fine. however the food was terrible. main meal was a choice of chicken curry and rice or a veggie pasta. breakfast before landing was a cold box consisting of a croissant bag of cranberries and a granola bar. what has happened to the 2 meat choices? (veggies choose veggie option in advance) and a cooked breakfast? ba have a british flag on the tail but do not serve any british food. i'm a silver executive club member and food on ba has been deteriorating over the last couple of years. i've made several complaints.,no
no,flew lhr to muscat return in club world on a 777-200 (g-zzza). loyal ba customers and have flown club world many times. ba long haul fleet starting to show it's age cabins looking a bit old and some of the equipment not working as it should. on our flight my tv would not stay in position and kept falling back into it's default position (and therefore not viewable). had to stuff some coffer cup protectors under the pivot arm to keep it in place. this is not the type of quality you expect when you are paying several thousand for your flights. food and service very good as usual. ba need to make sure that they inspect and make sure that everything works in the clud cabin every trip! when you paying the sort of money a club or first ticket costs you expect everything to be perfect. agee with other comments about club world layout it is starting to annoy me climbing over someone's legs to get out to use the toilet! generally still think ba is a good quality product but haven't tried emirates qatar etc. yet!,yes
no,economy class on 28 aug from london (lhr) to new york (jfk). boarding was in terminal 5 which i love as i can sit for some time in caffe nero have a coffee and watch airplanes take off or land. i choose ba just because of their terminal 5. boarding went quite smoothly and the flight was full. it took about 40 minutes till we actually took off after the time we were supposed to. the seat i had wasn't comfortable the cushion was moving and the seat wasn't firm. the inflight entertainment had a limited choices of movies which was disappointing and the screens were small and sometimes were not working. flight attendants were all women who were polite and smiling they did their best to make it a pleasurable flight. toilets were clean. the headphones were broken and i had to ask for new ones. we landed on time. it took 15 minutes till the plane could park and then another 30 minutes to get off because as the captain informed us there was a long line at immigration and we would have to wait for them to give us the go ahead. inside terminal 7 there was a huge line it took 2.5 hours to finally reach an officer. this was by far the most annoying and tiring experience i have had. to land at 10.45pm and get out at 2am is just too much. i will now choose an airline that lands in a terminal which can handle large numbers of passengers more effectively.,yes
no,ba15 lhr to sin b777-300er first class: nice a (four months old) but a few signs of wear already. the seat (2k) was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. useful wardrobe with enough space to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. things have to be left loose in the foot-well area. footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped i'd imagine. seat itself fine and comfortable. good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey. cabin lighting and temperature perfect. view of outside restricted by the angle of the seat - just when it is interesting (t/off and landing) you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside - the child in me i guess! food and service excellent. the toilets - wow - a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. middle-eastern airlines are so much better - ba really has to re-think. overall ba first class is equivalent to others business class. cabin crew very attentive - if only they had a better product to work with.,no
no,"travelled as a family of four to the maldives. despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. the plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. this seems to be an issue on ba routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to mauritius. on that trip the entertainment system failed all together. on the return journey from male i watched what i thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". only after watching the third part did i discover that there was a fourth or more! why? why would you not have all the story? this experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the ba service in business on this route. when you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. they don't need the space! would also have been nice to sit together! food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. a ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. there seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. on the outbound journey i pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. i returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. on the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. food was equivalently poor. this is the second ba business class trip i've taken to the maldives and each time i have been disappointed given the cost. i've also travelled economy on emirates to male which was actually better and business on emirates which was fantastic. i know ba have monopoly on the direct route from gatwick to male but i will be going via dubai on emirates in future.",yes
no,boston return. very quick check-in at heathrow let down by slow fast track (but that's the airports fault). b gate lounge quiet nice refreshments-i don't think the children's games consoles have worked in the entire time t5 has been open. short walk to boarding full plane left slightly early landed well ahead of schedule. crew excellent worked hard throughout. decent food as well (again). entertainment out on new system good older system back not as good and screen not in best order. return flight same comments pretty much except my wife's video system didn't work on way back so they just let her sit in first!. keep it up ba.,no
no,"bkk-lhr-edi-lhr-bkk outbound flight up to standard but not above and beyond but this is standard in ba which cannot compare with the top tier airlines. return flights similar. faults lay in ground services at edi and t5 in lhr the latter overcrowded and rather scruffy. return flight had no magazines (""they forgot to load"") or individual bottled water (""they forgot to load""). have a need to return to uk so will try an alternative (which is a night flight). why did ba stop night flights last autumn?",yes
no,lgw-mco-lgw 11-25th august economy class. got to the gate lounge to be told our seats has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why - it was because there was a big family party that didn't want to separate - considering i paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. got on to the plane thinking it would be the same as virgin atlantic but no it wasn't it was an old plane tatty one as well. food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour flight no snacks on board. the food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we didn't get burnt. well sorry ba next time i am flying with va!,no
no,lgw-faro return 19th/26th aug economy 2 adults 2 children. whole experience from check in to arrival in faro outstanding. as a regular traveller on this route have now got used to the ex bmi airbuses on this route the seating is perfectly comfortable despite the reduced seat pitch and have never had any problems when requesting more than one drink during the flight. the crew were fantastic in both directions and were totally service orientated from start to finish. only one minor issue and that is the only one toilet at the rear for the whole economy cabin!,yes
no,"lhr-yyz. checked in at 10.00am for my 13.10 departure. check in was quick. then proceeded through fast track which was not ""fast"". the lounge was quite busy but the staff were very helpful. departed on time and before take off were offered drinks. we were on the new b787 so the aircraft was nice and clean. i sat in 1f. it converted into a flat bed which was good. about 20 mins into the flight the drinks run came through. when then we asked for what we will having for lunch. i choose the salmon for starters which was excellent. for mains i choose the chicken option which was good but the veg was very hard. finally i choose the ice cream for dessert. landed on time and got our bags quickly.",yes
no,i flew from london to sydney club world / business class. having done similar oz flights recently with qatar airlines the experience was like comparing the premium to third division football clubs. everything about ba was shoddy shabby and second rate - so sad. numerous examples from the business lounge the lay out of the cabin the comfort of the seats privacy food service - all second rate. and for about £2 k extra flight cost. why? i would seriously consider flying to sydney via perth next time - longer but an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along. really pains me to say this - a very poor way to present a country's airline.,no
no,ba12 15th august 2014. in my mind that when i bought the ba tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. it turned out to be totally wrong. i used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with ba from changi airport to heathrow was the worst in so many ways. not worth money spent at all! firstly the seat space was really small (i cant imagine those who are bigger than i am because i am a medium size person). secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. they only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. the movies selection must have been 2 years old. flimsy earphones and outdated screens. all in all an unhappy customer.,yes
no,bari to gatwick. this flight seems to be late on a regular basis. three times an hour late and once two hours late this summer of the four times i was involved. seems the summer schedule is very optimistic check-in at bari is hopeless always queues and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. boarding is poor regularly left to wait in a hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. none of this done by ba staff but they are doing ba's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to london. onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. my flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage. a lot for ba to address here.,yes
no,gatwick to cancun 777-200 club world return in july. old plane which i think ba use out of gatwick. food - i can't understand how they can get it so wrong. we flew virgin upperclass to cancun but had to use ba this year due to date's will not use ba again. cabin crew not too bad but could be better. save your money or go with virgin.,yes

no,lhr-lax and ord-lhr. great crew on both flights. the new aircraft are great although i preferred the 777-300er to the a380 as the journey was more comfortable and more legroom at the back off the 777. ba really have upped their game and would happily fly with them again in the future.,yes

no,"dxb-lhr b777-200er ba0108 august 18 first class. transferred from an emirates flight in dxb. ba dxb galleries lounge reception staff member excellent. boarding reasonable with an on-time departure. cabin crew outstanding and definitely lived up to the ""to fly. to serve"" ba slogan. food tasty and well presented but not quite first class and cost-cutting was evident. the new first seat is comfortable though the footrest is poorly designed and a storage area for small inflight items is missing. ife monitor controls and selection very good but the screen could be more adjustable for reach. lovely cabin ambience including colors textures mood lighting and window blinds. toilets cramped and stocked with the cheapest liquid soaps and toilet paper. overall an enjoyable flight but as a longstanding and very loyal ba customer (gold tier) i ask that they seriously consider improving their product in an increasingly competitive market. arrived a little late at lhr with remote stand disembarking and bus transfer to t5.",yes
no,i flew from gatwick to rome and back on holiday and was pleasantly surprised by the standard of food and service. the salad on the outward flight was exceptional and the steward on the return leg (in a near-full cabin) was anticipating what passengers might want. ba food baffles me. i've flown first a few times in the past few years and the food was so bad i thought ba should pay compensation as well as refunding the flight ticket. in business it is usually ok. the only letdown this time was the lounge at gatwick. it was like a ryanair holding pen.,yes
no,on 28th july flew from edinburgh to gatwick. flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means i will never use them again. 1) information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) at no time was any refreshment offered. 3) the flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) no breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5) although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6) they then proceeded to leave our luggage at edinburgh while we travelled to gatwick. 7) after giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8) it then took them two days to locate them and send them from edinburgh to gatwick. would i use again or recommend - never in a month of sundays.,no
no,i flew from munich to boston via heathrow t5 (15 august 2014): munich to heathrow first flight out of munich at 7.20. the flight was good leaving on time but due to flight delayed arriving from london the night before so we did not get breakfast served on business class. from heathrow t5 to boston as the flight was nice but the business seat was ok nothing special in comparison to other airline like iberia business which is much nicer. the cabin crew was nice and friendly food was nice as i have selected to have only salad instead of hot meal. i managed to have a good rest all the way to boston after the meal.,no
no,lhr-ewr club world. offered 400 gbp upgrade from prem econ a day prior. t5 lounge experience positive - good selection of food which was well labelled. had a treatment - chair massage and elemis staff were most attentive. dreamliner is a great way to fly - although delayed half an hour arrived ahead of time. felt relaxed - addressed by name throughout and the crew was friendly and yes smiled. two hot towel services and the multi course dinner was served without fuss. not sure about the wash bag- although it is more convenient to carry off. entertainment options are excellent. baggage waiting for me at carousel. good flight for ba.,yes
no,ba 56 jnb-lhr 15 august 2014 business class a380 upper deck. the flight did not live up to expectations. too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. the window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. i thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off? the 747 business class is more comfortable than a380.,yes
no,we paid £2500 to upgrade to world traveller plus when we got to departure lounge we were upgraded to business class which was brilliant but air hostess made a point of letting us known plus other people that we had a free upgrade. on the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour. paid a lot of money to fly to maldives have no choice to fly ba to go direct stewards male or female need to remember that we are customers paying a lot of money for a service.,no
no,i flew london to beijing in club world on ba039 on aug 7. the cabin was a disgrace. i sat in the upper deck seat 62a and what worried me was the filthy window the metallic looking tape on the emergency exit door and the foam strip that was hanging down. in addition the carpet and lockers were filthy inside. food and service were excellent but i will vote with my wallet and boycott ba from now on wherever possible.,no
no,lgw-tfs-lgw club europe. travelled with hand baggage only given the well publicised issues with swissport baggage handling at lgw. outbound flight (15/7/2014) was ba at its best. on time departure (a rarity it seems at lgw for ba) a320 in fair condition with additional leg room in club europe and two excellent flight attendants. the return (22/7/2014) was a different story. probably my worst ba flight ever. delayed departure from tfs though only about 10 minutes late in arrival at lgw. no additional leg room on this a320 in club europe. lazy cabin crew who did the bare minimum with limited grace. and screaming infants out of control toddlers and ignorant teenagers in the club europe cabin - not the airline's fault but they could have and should have done more to manage the situation. one example - two teenagers in row 1 immediately reclined their seats into the faces of the couple in front of us after take off. the cabin crew didn't even make the teenagers raise their seats during the meal service. all credit to the couple in front of us though. they had the manners not to recline their seats into our faces. the substantial premium to fly club europe is just not worth it when other people's children are not controlled and the promised additional 'personal space' is not provided. scores are an average of both flights: outbound top marks across the board (bar entertainment there was none) inbound i would have preferred to score zero.,yes
no,18 august 2014 gatwick to orlando flight details and departure went well. however when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my father in law doesn't eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunch/dinner. this was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken (chicken again!) which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. again my father in law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. pretty poor show british airways as we travelled with virgin to mexico in june this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunch/dinner with enough for everyone! again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films tv and games which was something you need on a long journey again ba was not able to provide. ba your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money! i wouldn't not fly ba again as i don't like to limit my choices however i would definitely prefer to fly virgin in future. in my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didn't go down well with a large number of passengers what's happened to good old ham or cheese?,no
no,we flew from lhr to luxembourg on an afternoon flight we enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea and champagne because it was my husbands birthday. flight attendants very efficient and jolly we felt very much as if we were having a really nice birthday celebration up in the sky! baggage received very quickly on both flights. we travelled back in economy and it was really good with drinks and a biscuit or crisps. only problem was that there was no place for the aircraft to park up when we got in due to bad weather. we were off as quickly as they could so it wasn't too bad!,no
no,we flew the a380 from lax-lhr-jnb-lhr-lax in august 2014 in business class. this plane was designed by someone who never flew it. the seats are so close together with no room on the window side to get out when the seats are flat. a person has to put up the foot rest for a place to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. in addition the person on the window seat gets all the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. they have put so many people in each row that the seats are very narrow. there is virtually no place ( a small drawer at the seat) for personal items to be used during the flight without getting out of the seat to get something from the overhead.,yes
no,my journey was from bom to lhr (i had a connecting flight from lhr to mia surprisingly enough the transit at lhr wasn't all that bad). aircraft 777-200. got a complimentary upgrade from world traveler to world traveler plus. the seat was good and spacious service was professional and the food was nice especially the english breakfast that was served prior to landing. the only drawback was the absence of overhead air vents which at times made it a little stuffy and the in-flight entertainment which lacked the variety of emirates for example. overall a pleasant experience. wouldn't mind flying with ba again at all.,no
no,sad to say ba missed a big opportunity when their new 787 and a380 entered service. same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. compared to many airlines the ba premium service is poor and i don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. the cabin crew were excellent though i will concede. food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. the 787 was good and ba have improved their ife system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium. pay more get less.,yes
no,ba25 aug 8th lhr-hkk. club world. upper deck. overall a good flight. the service was a bit robotic. pre- departure drinks offered. main and breakfast served. for the main course i opted for the healthy / light meal which was tasty and just what i wanted as i was trying to avoid a heavy meal before bed. i was surprised at the limited wine selection: two whites and two reds. i had a nz sauv blanc which was tasty but 'connoisseurs' may have felt restricted by choice. the staff were overall very pleasant and happy to help when asked but just weren't pro-active. passengers (myself included) were having to ask for things that should have been attended to without request. they seemed 5 minutes too slow for drink rounds meal service etc. this is a small complaint however as i managed a solid 7 hours of sleep and the overall experience was good. the entertainment system on the a380 is much improved and is as good as any i have flown vssg etc. the window seat is certainly more private and feels much more spacious with the storage compartments under the windows and i would recommend these - especially over middle seats. all in all a solid business class but still lagging behind the likes of cx or sg primarily because of service and seat layout. there is a 'britishness' to the product which still makes me smile.,no
no,"june 25th 2014. my wife and daughter boarded in boston. the door was closed and we were ready to depart for london. then a baggage cart hit the airplane. we deplaned and that was understandable. after an hour we were told the plane would not depart and there was no room on any other planes for days. ""call your friends - make your own arrangements!"" was the only customer relations help offered by british airways. the ba help on the ground said there were no hotels on vouchers. i really yes really thought british airways was the standard of air travel. if you have any alternative do not book british airways. they're great as long as everything is going as planned. if anything goes wrong they are a confused people who have no idea how to help you.",yes

no,lhr - houston - lhr. two of us travelled using avios and amex companion voucher. excellent cabin crew on both sectors very good selection of wine and food pretty decent particularly outbound. the staff in houston even found and returned my ipod which i had left on the aircraft on the outbound sector.,yes
no,i was on ba 835 from dublin to lhr on 25th july 2014 which left dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that i had sufficient time to connect with my flight from lhr to hong kong. on leaving dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! on reaching lhr we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to gatwick and were running out of fuel. in summary we sat on the tarmac at gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for lhr and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. on reaching lhr ba staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. i was lucky as i managed to get on my flight to hong kong with cathay pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. whilst i understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that ba appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in ba's absence in the top 10 airline ratings. could do a lot better!,no
no,flight ba 937 dusseldorf to london on 13th march and ba 932 back to dusseldorf on 15th march. both flights served by airbus a319. cabin was in a good shape seat pitch 34 inch and the width 17 inch. lounge in dus (airport owned lounge) is quite nice but nothing special lounge of ba in lhr t5 is very good with a lot of space even it was very busy at this time but anyway we know it from other times when it was quite empty. no check-in because of hand luggage only. ba 937 was delayed for about 1 hour due to foggy weather in london so the very nice staff start to serve drinks to reduce the waiting time on ground. brunch served after takeoff a choice between a cold platter with assorted cheese and meat and bread/rolls or a warm cheese and ham croissant and salad. drinks including champagne were served twice. more enough for that relatively short flight. check-in for ba 932 (bought liquids) in t5 was very quick also friendly staff. ba lounge as i wrote was busy but worth it to reduce waiting time. very nice flight attendants drinks served 3 times light dinner with mixed salad. no real inflight entertainment (like on most intraeuropean flights) small tv´s with flight information.,yes
no,heathrow to newark on 787. flight was pleasant and comfortable. left heathrow 1 hour late but arrived on time. seat was comfortable and food was ok. service was excellent but had to walk outside in the rain to catch a bus to take us to our plane. would recommend ba due to service and heathrow t5.,yes
no,travelled lhr-yyz ba97 on 9 july returning ba96 28july. check-in at lhr an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. galleries lounge at the south end of t5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. outbound aircraft was g-bnlg surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. on boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off and landing most peculiar. the head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out - i have questioned if this is a new ba policy for daytime flights. departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international business class elsewhere. immigration and baggage delivery in yyz very swift. for the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge at pearson is ok but nothing special. aircraft this time was g-bgyc the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with ba's club world seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something i personally dislike. food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. unfortunately it was no better than going to mcdonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew? flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. all in all the experience was what i expect from ba these days average at best.,no
no,flight from heathrow to newark. the new dreamliner was fantastic. very comfortable quiet and clean. the cabin crew were superb very professional with customer service being their priority. i appreciate that flying on a new aircraft makes a difference to the flight however if ba continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service i can see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering ba's avios points usage which allows all of your points to be spent on flights. virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each flight. i've flown with ba and virgin many times it was a nice attempt by virgin advertising themselves in terminal 5 however when you're sat in terminal 5 after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a brand new aircraft it's hard to see the advertisements working.,yes
no,great service from lcy-angers in western france on embraer 175. london city airport is so very convenient for london dwellers and the flights were very comfortable. saturday flight outbound was totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not even the breakfast of a disappointingly hard croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the positive impression. coming back on the wednesday was less than half-full so double drinks and snacks all round! tickets were £120 return which seems very reasonable considering the alternative for the region is ryanair to tours from stansted for almost as much and once you factor in the extra price of luggage and snacks with them ba wins hands down.,no
no,06.40 flight 4 august glasgow to london city cancelled with no explanation. typical ba service nobody about to assist with alternative arrangements or any concept of customer care. so much for the worlds favourite airline. third rate which is what i have come to expect from them.,yes
no,lis-lhr on 30 july j class on an airbus 320. i was expecting more however i was disappointed. seat was ok but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. no inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. however we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a business class seat. will fly ba again but i am more keen to intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than european routes.,yes
no,porto-lhr economy. pushed back late but arrived on time. flight was full but good cabin service with sandwiches and drinks. a very good standard overall.,yes
no,upgraded from premium economy to business from yvr (vancouver) to lhr (london). the club world cabin was full and a couple of the passengers had been upgraded to first. despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though). seat is nice and wide but if you're facing rearwards on the 747 you could be sitting right next to someone you don't know. the ife had a lot of choice and had many new movies to chose from. altogether a good flight.,no
no,upgraded to business class on return flight from verona. absolute disgrace. flight left around 11.30pm but lounge closed at 9.20pm. lounge was awful dirty and very little in the way of business class facilities. flight was cattle class and i have seen more organisation and courtesy on an easyjet flight. boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. flight had run out of food. worst flight in memory and absolute shocking customer service. absolute joke and how they have the audacity to claim it was business class they should be accountable n the trade descriptions act.,yes
no,ams-lcy economy. embraer aircraft only half-full at most and on time. for such a short flight a high standard of cabin service with wine and a small snack offered. an excellent flight in all respects.,yes
no,lhr-sin 26 july 2014. upgraded from wtp to club world before i even had the chance to ask. value for money was a '5' because i didn't pay for the flight! flight went well and i even managed some sleep on the fold flat bed. cabin crew were pleasant and helpful one of the attendants retrieved his own usb adapter from his luggage so that i could charge my phone (i was a little surprised that there wasn't a usb port at my seat - upstairs 747). the same attendant appeared in the passport control hall and called out - without success unfortunately - looking for a passenger who had left his glasses behind. food was absolutely fine and the burgundy a little too drinkable. this was probably up there as one of the better flights i've taken - most are done under sufferance but this one was pretty good overall.,no
no,26th july lgw to orlando. drinks service from the crew was good. champagne upon boarding and a top up without requesting. it was greatly appreciated! food was not outstanding but pleasant enough. overall the cabin service was good. several services of drinks and top ups when requested. what let this flight down was the number of unruly children on this flight. i was in an outside seat on the port side and an 8 or 9 year old child in front got out of her seat every five minutes or so continually throughout the flight and her younger sibling was also jointing her when she did manage to stay put. i attempted to avail myself of the flat bed but three times these children stood on my legs as they clambered over into their seat. the parents of these children never once intervened to check their children's behaviour although they were well aware of how they were behaving. my wife did not have much luck either. the couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed legged in the isle playing with their children and their toys and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet. surely a tripping hazard! there were many other children on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parents set boundaries for their offspring. whilst ba cannot be held responsible for children's behaviour i feel that as we were in the club world cabin some sort of announcement should be made by ba requesting passengers with children respect the comfort of fellow passengers. p.s. the club lounge at gatwick was like a kindergarten but that is another story!,yes
no,"lhr-cph-lhr business class. this is a joke. scruffy aircraft with ripped upholstery dirty cabin and chaotic/slow ""service"". i know it's a short flight (90 mins) but it shouldn't take over an hour to get one cup of cold stewed tea. flight attendants including their ""manager"" didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. seats are actually narrow economy 3x3 configuration with the middle one kept vacant. inflight entertainment? easy there isn't any. for the price i paid this was an absolute disgrace. i seriously think i'd have a better experience with easyjet.",yes
no,lhr-cdg-lhr. outbound a320 on 26/7 return a319 on 27/7 in euro traveller. both flights boarded efficiently departed and arrived on time. seats were a bit tired but comfortable enough for a 60 minute flight. exit row (9) on a319 is worth taking if available as it provides extra legroom. refreshments only as the flight is too short for anything else.,no
no,"toronto to london in wtp on a 787 and london to toronto in club world on 747. there were elements of both flights where ba seemed to be back to their old self. the dreamliner in wtp was on time with some of the best cabin service i've experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. ba seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards - looks like wtp seems to have been demoted (again). fast bar service and good entree before the wtp service morphed into wt for breakfast which has reverted to ""muffin or nuffin"" and ts and cs and juice from paper cups. it really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. landing early at heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. the return flight in club was one of my best ever. the lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. on board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. a calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of ba at it's best. an on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. why can't they do this more often? (answer - variable cabin crew).",yes
no,12/2013. lhr-lax. a380. aircraft was clean. seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the ife- computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. there were no eye shades and ear plugs. food both ways the same selection: tikka masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. fa's lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. there was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. ife-system is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences. this experience with british airways is not compatible to other flag carriers due to the lack in service and the restricted seating.,yes
no,ba206 from miami to lhr on upper deck dinner took over 3 hours to complete. 2 staff obviously not sufficient. very old 747 tv screens going from colour to b&w frustrating as had more than enough time to watch a couple of movies while dinner was not served.,yes
no,i have used ba over the past 20 years as i chose to move my airmiles to their plan regretted it ever since and will use them up as soon as possible. even when flying on a paid flight i find the staff snooty they have a bad customer attitude. at the moment i am trying to check in on a flight only chosen because it was the best option for my multiple stops and the on line check in does not work. told by staff member never mind just do it at the airport not much point in reporting it because they won't do anything for 24 hours. that is good customer service as you can only check in 24 hours before hand. i have had lost luggage twice on the same trip had my seat changed for no reason (someone else was able to use my original choice so not a seat problem) flights changed but was able to change them back to the original booking. i have travelled economy and premium economy and flown 10 hours with no inflight entertainment.,yes
no,flight ba935 dus-lhr on 31/5/2014 onboard g-eupu (a319). flight was on time and smooth. a drink was served together with a small sandwich. crew was good and the seats were also fine for this short flight.,yes
no,flight ba283 lhr-lax on 31/5/2014 onboard g-xlee (a380). flight was punctual and very smooth. a nice breakfast and dinner was served during this flight. we also received an ice cream which was very tasty. crew was good and friendly. only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. we were seated on the upper deck on row 74. a very big advantage is that the seating is in a 2-4-2 configuration and the window seats have a very nice 'bin' were you can put all your stuff.,yes
no,round-trip with family from jfk to hyd via lhr. onward flight was delayed at jfk by 2 hrs. was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. inflight service was good. transit at lhr was a nightmare! mile long walk after alighting to central point in terminal 5. no gate information anywhere. had to check-in again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby! though departing flight was from same terminal 5 had to now walk 30-40 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate - c63. now here the gate agent wouldn't let our carry on through. said it was too big. so had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carry-on. return flight again was delayed. had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. transit at lhr was thankfully better this time. but the aircraft to jfk was an old 747 - falling apart. no bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. old seats kept reclining on its own. a/c was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck. never going to fly british again or pass through lhr again!,no
no,lhr-bsl-lhr 22nd/23rd july ba748 and ba755 a319 each way bag drop at t5 seemed to take ages. once through used the north lounge which was pretty full at this time of the day. flight delayed a little and arrived about 15min late service on this 1hr 20min flight was fine for economy class a sandwich and drink supplied return bag drop in basel quick used the euro lounge which was very nice. return flight quick boarding very full a sandwich and drinks served and again service good for a short flight arrived t5 bit late but bags recovered and out in 30 min.,no
no,we flew to rome from newcastle via heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home i received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in heathrow was awful. we were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so i had to push wheelchair myself.,yes
no,flight ba274 las-lhr on 8/6/2014 onboard g-civb (b747). flight was on time and smooth. catering was very average and small portions. quality was much less then ba standard. crew was good but we didn't see them for a very long time during this flight. only 2 drink rounds were made during this 9.5 hour flight everyone knows that is not enough. seats were good with just enough legroom.,yes
no,ba2262 on 17th feb 2014. i was in 4a from jamaica to london gatwick and no need to climb over anyone’s legs and you're close to the toilet and the galley were your can help yourself. seat is very good and good space. great meal i had the chicken curry very good and a nice bottle of wine to help it down. the stewards were very helpful. going to grenada soon and see they have first on the flight so going to try that.,no
no,dme-lhr july 23 club world seat 64a. it was quite a novelty travelling on a 747 aircraft for a flight just over three hours long. i sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. i chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. i did not use the seat as a bed but used the z position which is very good for relaxing. the food and wine choices were very good and the club kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.,yes
no,lhr-dme on 19 july seat 1a club world. i flew on one of the converted a321 jets that bmi used to own and was very impressed with the seat. the configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. there is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. the seat also has a built in massage function. the tv screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. the service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.,no
no,"flew on a 777-200 from london heathrow to san diego worst flight i have taken on british airways. being a rather tall person 6'7"" and travelling in economy the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and i was asked to remove my knees so he could recline stating to cabin crew that i would not have a comfortable journey they did not seem to care. when the food was served i could not even put my tray table down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. so to tell you the truth i spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight in the toilet at least in there i could stretch out my legs. wrote a letter to british airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. just shows you they really care about their passengers.",no
no,domestic edinburgh-gatwick. late by 40 mins but that's not unusual. flight itself lovely clean quiet made up some time. crew smart and friendly. only down side was coming off a bridge to a closed gate to then being herded onto a packed bus. bags came fairly quickly sometimes at lgw it can be a while!,yes
no,lhr-bsl-lhr a319's each way check/bag drop att5 took ages around 40 min. once checked in lounge and boarding good seat 15c enough time for a coffee and sandwich arrived a little late due to weather. return similar flight experience same food very full flight bag drop at bsl very quick and very nice lounge. departed a little late and arrived 20 min late otherwise good experience nice crew in both directions.,yes
no,dme-lhr. b747-400. used avios to sample the 'new' first. the check-in area at dme was very congested but i did not have to queue. the lounge had plenty of not very comfortable seats and limited food and beverages. the gate area was more like a holding pen and was much too small for a 747 load. first and club ended up boarding through a different gate number. once on board i was shown to my seat and given an explanation about the seat functions. service from the mature crew was excellent (there were only one other passenger in first). the food was ok but not particularly exciting. the main disappointment was the seat and amount of personal space with only enough room for shoes and a jacket in the wardrobe. everything else had to go in the overhead locker. there seemed to be too many seats crammed into the cabin. i moved from 1k to 3k as this had a bit more space and privacy than the others. from my experience ba first should be called club world plus.,yes
no,we had a flight from lax to zhr via lhr. the leg from lax to lhr was on a a380-800 (g-xlea) was very good. aircraft was clean and in perfect condition. we had bulkhead seats for whole family - perfect (be aware: bulkhead seats were very cold because of a/c). flight was full and leaving on time and boarding was stress less. entertainment was very good - touchscreen is a little bit slow but selection is huge. food and service very good - beef was delicious. staff very friendly and helpful with our kids. the leg from lhr to zrh was on a regular a320 nothing special.,yes
no,14/7/14 trinidad-st lucia-lgw club. on the way down from st lucia ba has an inexplicable outdated crew change. they are the ones from the previous days flight having a two day holiday in st lucia. check in at pos is usually unprofessional trini-style. ba shares a lounge which has a colonial style dress code so i had to nip to the loo to change from my shorts to trousers left on time for the 45min trip to st lucia where the bulk of holidaymakers board back to lgw. i was positive as i heard the new pos-st lucia cabin crew ask each other if they wanted a beer! they then landed in st lucia and were busy saying goodbye to each other and the incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to the departing pos-st lucia passengers! st lucia-lgw with new crew. girl came around with newspapers and i said 'ft' please which she had in her hand but she had no clue what the ft was! did not dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is clear as soon as the various jobs are done by various designated crew that's it. new male wash bag is a laugh so i asked for the female wash bag which actually is slightly better. flight got very cold and i asked for an extra blanket. told politely but firmly 'sorry' yet there were loads in overhead lockers which i found later. the point about most ba flights these days is to expect nothing and when u get the odd staff member who actually does that extra to consider it as a bonus.,yes
no,mad to lcy business. great lounge at madrid flight boarding very good food awful service poor arrival at lcy good however baggage awful all bags through but mine priority last off!,yes
no,flew lcy to mad in business only 3 people in a cabin for 12 no welcome no pre take off drinks very poor service awful food warm drinks turbulence as we got in the air dealt with very well. overall very poor service.,no
no,"got a wonderful cheap fare from london city to florence £56 each way! london city a delight to travel through except when your flight is badly delayed which sadly ours was. no announcements made to tell anyone what was happening 2 hour delay shown on the departure board popped up at boarding time. actually a ba fan but this was handled very badly. no information or assistance. then when we boarded we were delayed by another hour thankfully once on board the cabin crew and pilots were great at communicating and almost made up for the bad handling by ground staff. great hot breakfast and drinks served on board on the way out. the return flight was on time and again a lovely crew and a very acceptable snack and drink service. excellent value compared to the ""low cost"" carriers no extra charges for bags etc allowed and free drinks if you wanted them. apart from the delay outbound a wonderful trip. would have been a 10/10 had we left on time.",yes
no,we had a flight from zrh to sfo via lhr. the leg from zrh to lhr on a regular a320 nothing special. the leg from lhr to sfo was on a 747-400 (g-civy) was very good. aircraft was clean and in a good condition. entertainment was not perfect but sufficient. food and service very good - beef was delicious. staff were very friendly and helpful with our kids. flight itself was very calm perfect flight for all of us.,yes
no,doh-bah-lhr-lax flight started from doha with a short hop to bahrain to pick up more passengers. check in was ok but was over baggage allowance by 1 kilo so made me pay. flight departed on time with an older 777 with broken ac so everyone was roasting inside the plane not good in a very hot middle eastern summer told it would be better once airborne - had to endure twice due to stop over in bahrain. crew were fantastic though very welcoming the moment i stepped onboard compensated the lack of ac. dinner was served and it was good nothing to write home about as was breakfast. ife old with no avod capabilities so movies are on the loop and few channels with old movies. arrived at lhr terminal 3 - nice very quite very early in the morning so few people and shops around. flight to lax again on an older 777 but new ife with avod this time crew mixed bag male crew a bit rude. food - lunch was ok like the dessert but small portions bring lots of food and 2 hours before arrival a sad sandwich and yoghurt was serve other carriers serve full meal as second meal or snack and around that time ife crashed on half the plane nothing to do about it good thing it was almost arrival time pretty boring flight and full as well arrived on time and bags were out in 10 minutes that is if you can come out of immigration faster. it was an ok long flight very disappointing but it did get me where i wanted to be.,yes
no,"lgw-bgi-lgw club world r/t. old careworn b777-200. airplane was not clean both sectors. food outbound from gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. inbound airplane toilets reeked. at least food on return was slightly improved. cabin crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. the club world seats are narrow and uncomfortable. the inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. screens poor and tiny selection of movies. ba's so called business class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. i am amazed that british airways standards are so low and they get away with it. this is mere a to b transport. what is missing from their business class is ""class"".",yes
no,10th july ba117 lhr-jfk. well i have not flown with ba for a number of years as they are not my favourite airline from past experience. we were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. decided to not pre purchase seats but go for online check in and seat selection. all very easy and got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. so we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards get rejected you need to get your passport and visa validated from the ba desk before you can proceed. would be good if this was shown on boarding pass. boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging. all the crew seemed very good. i walked off the aircraft with my view of ba restored would i fly again with them yes.,yes
no,flew got-lhr-lax and back on the new a380. flight from got-lhr was alright even though the flatbread they served was inedible. transferred through t5 quick and easy. must say that heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! the long haul flight on ba's a380 was excellent. i was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also i was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. the staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than i could've imagined for an economy route. the whole experience was overall better than i'd thought for a 500$ ticket and so far the best i've gone with when it comes to flights over the atlantic.,no
no,flew lhr to mumbai return with my husband - very disappointing. the galleries lounge at terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by ba. the food was below average. unable to avail ourselves of the spa' facilities as they were fully booked. not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue! we had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. when we boarded the aircraft (boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. the 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. the seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. my ife did not work on the return flight. the in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. check-in at mumbai for the return flight was very slow. we were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. the business class lounge at mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. no facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. the whole experience of ba's club world was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.,no
no,lhr-cph-lhr. business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. no inflight entertainment at all both operated by a320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. the biggest gripe i have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. come on ba these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.,yes
no,lhr-fra-lhr in spotlessly clean airbuses both looked brand new (although they weren't). crews were immensely friendly and helpful with a smile for everybody. slight delay on the return leg but kept well informed. only minus point is the remote stands at fra that slow boarding and disembarkation to a snails pace.,yes
no,flew jnb-lhr return. only considered ba because they fly the a380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. ba have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. the a380 is a considerable improvement. only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time i got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. but i really only recommend flying the a380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,yes
no,"very disappointed with my flight back from munich although it's only 2 hours all that was offered was a small basket consisting of a packet of nuts or shortbread. the flight over to munich was considerably better being offered chicken curry wrap etc. we were told when booking this return in munich that there was only one seat left however once in the aircraft there were still seats left including one next to me! however it's really the snack offered that's my main ""bone of contention"" as we chose british airway in preference to the cheap budget airlines but we now find there's little difference in the on flight catering.",no
no,i flew with british airways with my mother from paphos to manchester. she had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. i was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! i think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. i will never fly with ba again.,no
no,just taken a ba flight lhr-jfk rtn. outstanding service staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. the cabin director found out it was my dad's 60th birthday and gave him a bottle of champagne to take away. very friendly and nothing too much trouble. we flew on older 747 and newer 777 with latest interior - both very comfortable plenty of leg room and entertainment great. screen on older aircraft a little small but much better on newer. food was the best i had on any airline. restaurant quality without a doubt.,yes
no,paris - london - nassau. all flights on time. flight from paris to london on a319 was a short trip and comfortable. the 2nd flight from london to nassau on an old 767. food was good and tasty with plenty of drinks on offer. flight was not too crowded so plenty of room for people to spread about the cabin. only issue with the flight was the avod which was very old so picture was not so clear and sound terrible. other than that a good experience.,yes
no,london gatwick to bari. bag drop very slow and couldn't print luggage tag. plane an old 737 but very well preserved clean and very tidy. cabin crew very nice. as always the pilot explained the real reason for the one hour delay. why do ground crew always say 'due to late arrival of incoming aircraft'? sandwich lunch very nice and good drink selection. once onboard a very good experience.,yes
no,ba026 7th july seat 66b. arrived hk off a connecting cx flight was able to use the qf lounge close to the gate at hkia boarding very quick and was upgraded to wt+ at the gate which was welcome after travelling from london to malaysia and back over 3 days. i like the a380 very quiet seats are very comfortable in wt+ this being my 5th trip on ba's 380 departed on time ife was good however crew and food not the best on this flight i used tg between london bkk and kul 2 days earlier in economy and the food and crew were fantastic will continue using ba for now but tempted maybe use the star alliance again in future.,yes
no,went from sydney to singapore to london to lisbon a long flight over 27 hours including 2 hours each at sing and london. have flown with the asian carriers that were very good but flew ba this time as best value for lisbon. i was not expecting great service but was pleasantly surprised the planes were good with good entertainment and food was good. the staff were also pleasant and professional. only criticism was on all legs including return they did not ask people in front to raise seats when they served meals i asked in 2 cases and they asked person in front to raise seats but i saw many that did not ask and they did not get people to raise them. all other asian airlines come along and say when they are serving meals to raise seats.,no
no,i flew glasgow-gatwick-vegas-gatwick-glasgow. i have flown this way before as i get to put my baggage on at glasgow and forget about it. glasgow-gatwick no real comment other than cabin crew don't do much more than the minimum. flew premium economy on a 777-200 flight was full. premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say i was booked back to edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying ba that its best to carry snacks as they don't over feed you. of course when i got back to gatwick i ran into the french atc control strike no announcement made. after having to hang around gatwick all day i finally got a flight to glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to ba there. when i made a comment to ba customer service i was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to aircraft unserviceability when i queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s could offer no explanation as to why i was told different. i would like to complement ba but virgin totally beat them hands down.,yes
no,bridgetown to london gatwick on avios companion ticket. fantastic cabin crew - friendly yet professional - good and tasty choice of food and very nice selection of wines. after a few less than satisfactory ba experiences of late this one proved that they can deliver a top quality product.,no
no,lhr-yvr-lhr. flew in in first on very shabby 744 which was nothing like first was displayed on the bbc documentary about ba. squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. the staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. ob were the old contract crew and ib was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. food from lhr was palatable and from yvr was awful. on the return leg the ife was faulty. the fast track ob was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. i feel the bbc has hurt ba with first passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on tv. we were generally happy due to the fact that i used avios and an amex voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen air canada. ba really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. we will continue to use ba due to the avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons i could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either cw or first.,yes
no,travelled with my husband sister and brother inlaw to rome via heathrow. yep long flight so everyone kept reminding me when i told them where we were from. decided to upgrade to premium economy and thanks to our travel agent got a good deal. several years ago i was put off from flying british airways so thought i'd give them another go. wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to rome i felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. the premium eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from barcelona to gatwick which we were very grateful for. can't say the food was anything to rave about. when the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. apparently this is now common practice. just be upfront about it that's all. will defiantly investigate ba again though.,yes
no,flew yyz to lhr on 1st july. booked wt+ but was upgraded to club world at the gate which went some way to compensate for the awful outgoing flight (see separate review). fabulous flight very attentive flight attendants decent food (although the cannelloni was a bit dry) excellent wine only slight negative was that the 777 is a noisy aircraft even sitting near the front. overall this was ba at its best.,yes
no,lhr-iad ba 293 b772er club world. checked-in fairly quickly at the t5 first class counter due to gold tier status. security speed average despite fast track. first class lounge food good and the business centre worked well. boarding efficient in fast track. left the c terminal gate on time. staff reasonably efficient and friendly throughout the flight. the latest elemis wash bag is a bad joke! cw food is still quite disappointing and inconsistent with the pasta meal being quite dry. wines and beverage choice good. the eight-year old cw seat is in desperate need of a competitive replacement. eight across in cw is pathetic. the seamless seat cushion itself is very comfortable though the foot rest does not work well when combining the two to make a bed. if reduced to six across in cw there will be more room for the storage of small items needed during the flight and much more shoulder elbow and hip room. thankfully i did not have to jump over anyone's feet from my window seat as the aisle seat was unoccupied. baggage was awaiting my arrival after clearing immigration at iad. overall a reasonably pleasant flight but it is sad to see how the ba cw product has declined so much over the past 15 years. i am a very loyal ba customer and plan to remain so for now.,yes
no,we paid top money for club europe and upon leaving the uk we thought it was well worth it as great helpful check in fast track immigration and lovely lounge. once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the club europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the club europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to rome when all the club europe passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes. hopefully british airways will sort out the rome baggage handlers. flying them again next week we hope for a better experience.,no
no,montreal - lhr. i love ba but sometimes they have an off-day and this was one of them. crew not ready when passengers boarding - some still eating their crew food. pre-flight everything seemed rushed with no newspapers or amenity kits offered. flight itself was fine and food very good. landing at lhr we were parked remotely. my husband had requested assistance and we were told to wait until all the other passengers had disembarked (which took 20 minutes) only to have to join a bus with no help at all. needless to say no one on hand inside t5 and only by flagging down a passing buggy did we manage to get to border control. just not great.,yes
no,flew from lhr to yyz on 23 june on new 787. not impressed. very bumpy taxiing. smooth inflight but i couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. i was seated in a window seat. flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. this is unacceptable especially since i paid £30 extra to choose my seat! cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it i don't know - safety issue if nothing else. otherwise flight ok.,yes
no,flying from aberdeen to toronto via lhr. on board the new 787s on this route you can really notice the difference that they make over the 777. no drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey i was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. i would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what i saw). the small commuter plane from abz to lhr and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.,yes
no,lgw-jer return. out on b737 back on a319 both flights almost full.80 minute delay leaving gatwick due to french atc strike not airlines fault. going out no problems hand baggage only checked in online. return a different matter unable to check in online and no self service machines at jersey flybe have at least six. check in opened over half an hour after stated time when a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. she then managed to seat by wife and i in middle seats in different rows. customer service at jersey shows b.a. in a bad light. the flights were fine beer and snack both ways on a 30 minute leg.,yes
no,flew ba 025 heathrow to hong kong in first class seated in 1a july 2nd 2014. great flight great service and cabin crew were excellent. i have flown this sector many times and this is one of best flights that i have had on ba.,yes
no,travelled from oz to watch start of tdf in leeds. ba cancelled 7.20am flight 1340 5/7 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.50 flight and then expected me to get on the 15.30 same day return to london. very poor and lame excuse. to make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. amazed such a big airline can't manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to leeds to see the start of the 2014 tdf. what a disaster.,yes
no,i flew ams-lgw-mco and jfk-lhr-ams this month. overall is was an acceptable experience. food and drinks the normal airline stuff. staff were good and visited us often. i only found the seats very unpleasant.,yes
no,london lhr to hong kong on 27 may. was really looking forward to flying in the new a380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a b777. flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into hk. on boarding i agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. having ordered a vegetarian meal i let one of the cabin crew know that i'd swapped seats. when the meal was served i got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though i had. before i could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. food was ok. cabin crew smiles were forced. serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day. no way was world traveller plus worth the extra money.,no
no,flew lhr to larnaca and return 22nd april and 29th april in club europe. i had high hopes for business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat disappointed. legroom not quite what i expect from business class 34 inches is hardly room to stretch out. the service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what i expect from a business class experience. as for inflight entertainment? oh dear. on a 4.5 hour flight i expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. if you didn't like the film tough. all in all i will not rush to pay the extra.,yes
no,"lhr-sea in ""first"" class. the experience was really a step back in time. having arrived in london on jal after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class i had high expectations of my premiere flight in ba first. suffice to say i won't be back. whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? it's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. the whole cabin - and this is 'new' first i might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. the seat itself is narrow and displeasing. crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. that sums it up really - ba is simply not offering a world-class product. i can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile asian or middle eastern alternative available and even then i'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. i suggest that ba product managers might want to go on a world tour via abu dhabi tokyo hong kong and singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. there is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with ba and i sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class"".",no
no,i had flight from vancouver to london and back again aisle seat i prepaid for was changed to another aisle seat which put me right near the bathroom where i really didn't want to be. what's the point of selecting a seat online and prepaying for it and then they change it with no explanation? entertainment system was ok but the food (if you can call it that) was disgusting - chicken curry or pasta actually just curry since they ran out of pasta and left people with no choice. i've had better food on charter airlines - never again.,no
no,london gatwick to bridgetown on avios companion ticket. flight left and arrived on time. surprisingly good choice and quality of food and wine. entertainment system somewhat limited in choice. cabin crew were pretty poor. generally slow particularly in responding to the call button.,no
no,lhr-pek-lhr. we travel ba club world often and my overall impression is very good. yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with ba is unbeatable. and for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. contrary to general recommendations when i travel with a companion i prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. and if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck. strongly recommended for a discounted ticket.,no
no,"world traveller plus from beijing to london lhr. old and tired 747-400 these planes really should be pensioned off now. the cabin was freezing with everyone wrapped in blankets for the whole flight. complaints to the cabin crew just got a ""sorry we have no control over the air temperature"" response. veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so i had to have fish. video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it mattered as the system wasn't working properly so i couldn't watch any films. pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight. sound system for communicating with passengers was very distorted so it was impossible to understand any announcements from flight- deck or cabin crew apart from a little bit of extra leg room i've no idea what extra money for world travel plus is supposed to be for.",yes
no,cph-lhr 26th june. club europe. ba standards are slipping. the galleries lounges are a shadow of their former selves. in the latest round of savings a famous business broadsheet newspaper has been axed the food offerings curtailed and sub-standard and a lack of attention to clearing tables. however the on-board service continues to be of a high standard and the airbus 321 clean and tidy with very helpful cabin crew. flight was marred by a lack of bags loaded on the plane due to an it breakdown at t5 which caused a long queue at cph baggage dept. for reporting missing bags.,yes
no,have flown with ba several times over past few years mostly economy class on holiday through travel agents. aircraft's vary from a bit shabby with little space to sometimes a bit bigger and newer with a bit more space. staff always efficient and polite. the one main flaw is the snack food offering - those awful wraps which are like uncooked cold cardboard. we don't need a 3 course hot meal but eg a granary bread sandwich [with a veggie filling for us] would be preferable to the dreaded wraps which we do not eat which seems such a waste.,no
no,lhr to vie ba 704 23 june 2014. the meal service in euro traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the new mixed fleet crew the food offering was inedible a choice of flat bread with chicken tikka or a salad. do british airways not understand that not everyone likes curry or spicy food. at least do an offering of meat or cheese sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. as for the cabin crew this new mixed fleet with their thunderbird hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. at least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. this crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. i would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the duty free. i fly british airways every week and this is the worst crew i have known. i think the mixed fleet crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on ba start to bring back the high standards again the new mixed fleet crew are letting you down very badly.,yes
no,flew from lhr to hong kong april 13th 2014 ba 25 and the flight took off 1 hour late. therefore as i had an onwards connection to jakarta with limited time to get my connection i asked on board about help with getting my onwards boarding card to jakarta as ba in belfast refused to issue me a boarding card. the csd was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though i am ggl member. the only help i got was from one of the hong kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me. without her help i would have missed my onwards to jakarta. certainly not impressed by the service. i made a follow up compliant however never received any response.,yes
no,london - bkk premium economy 19/6/14. i always travel eva air business but this time i had to get into bkk early having been told by many that ba business is at best rubbish i decided to save some cash and go p/economy seat no: 14a remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and i was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. i must admit i didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. i was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. drinks g&t were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least i did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. the only redeeming factors were i didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike eva 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.,no
no,flew from lhr to hong kong april 13th 2014 ba 25 and the flight took off 1 hour late. therefore as i had an onwards connection to jakarta with limited time to get my connection i asked on board about help with getting my onwards boarding card to jakarta as ba in belfast refused to issue me a boarding card. the csd was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though i am ggl member. the only help i got was from one of the hong kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me. without her help i would have missed my onwards to jakarta. certainly not impressed by the service. i made a follow up compliant however never received any response.,yes
no,i flew from edinburgh to heathrow and then on to jfk and returned from las vegas. the flights in the uk were fine but the flight to jfk and from vegas to heathrow were terrible the seats were narrow and the food was disgusting both ways.,no
no,flight ba 202 boston to heathrow. aircraft b747 version 1. we were seated in pe. the cabin was quiet and not full so we had plenty of room. the cabin crew were very attentive and spoke to all the passengers in our cabin. service after take off was very quick and professional the food was very good and not hurried giving us 3.5 hours to sleep. the seats were very comfortable and the extra space was appreciated. my only complaint is my tv monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. it was not an issue as i was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. the cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and i had a good 3 hours sleep. the flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good. the breakfast was a croissant in a box which i found a bit of a disappointment. overall i would fly ba premium economy again.,yes
no,london heathrow to singapore. brand new 777-300 very comfortable very clean. entertainment was good and food tasty but very small portions. staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours. arrive early so cant complain. better than qantas flight singapore to brisbane.,no
no,we travelled cancun to lgw in business class. to the point i didn't think the experience was as good as virgin and emirates who i normally use. airport staff were helpful although i was surprised there was no lounge access at all ( we got 2x usd 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport). cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. dinner and wine/drinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as emirates or cathay. my friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passenger's legs. breakfast was sub standard.,no
no,i was excited to fly on the new a380 with the new seating. we sat in 14j and 14k. when we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. i sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and i inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. the power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. we had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. i not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. this is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. i was told i would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen.,yes
no,club world–lgw to tpa week later mia to lhr. gatwick check in quick and easy ba member came over and pointed us through fast track and gave lounge instructions. lounge food offering very disappointing compared to lhr made do with marmite on toast and lots of champagne! in celebratory mood as going for a 30th cabin crew outbound fantastic the drinks kept flowing and never a rolled eye or any surly attitude from the crew. managed 4/5 hours afternoon nap. upgraded wtp home bound to cw through avios 24hrs before and even bagged upper deck. an amazing night flight left on time. have always found ud crew fantastic two pre departure drinks and mixed fleet seemed genuinely flying to serve. only downside was pretty terrible dinner - starter and salad dreadful steak main not much better. requested tray be taken away and skip dessert. reclined and slept - and got woken 6 hours later for a bacon roll. landed at lhr on time through security four bags collected and out of airport in 25 minutes. club world and heathrow fantastic when it goes well. apart from food and beverage – a definite 10/10. will be a very sad day when the 747s retire ud on a380 far more cramped.,yes
no,edi-lhr-fco-lhr-edi. edi lounge good. flight to lhr on time food decent attentive crew. north lounge at t5 much better than chaotic south lounge. flight to fco by 3 cabin 767 so upgraded using avios - fully flat beds great fa's superb food good wine. lounge at fco okay food not great. flight delayed at fco due to storms at lhr so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. fa excellent food very good again. overall the flights and service were superb.,yes
no,"flew lhr-cpt-lhr as british airways is only carrier flying direct london to cape town. outward flight due to leave 21.30 delayed by nearly 3 hours and the communication at the departure lounge was abysmal lots of unhappy passengers at the lack of information being given out. fell asleep when finally got on board only to be woken an hour later to be given my ""special meal"" which i hadn't requested. told stewardess it was not for me and she rather huffily took it away. when the trolley came round with the regular meals i was not offered one - this suited me as i don't relish eating at 1 o'clock in the morning but thought it rather petty of them to ignore me. return flight was on time but had passenger from hell next to me who was too large for the very narrow economy seats so i spent the night sitting at an angle as it was impossible to sit straight with mrs large spilling over onto my seat. well done to the stewardess who put up with her obnoxious behaviour with a long suffering smile.",no
no,london gatwick to orlando. no surprises to guess that as our original flight to tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. after finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the ba system for an unexplained reason. what an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. no extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. after accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day ba then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from heathrow to charlotte to tampa. we did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. i declined this arrangement for a flight instead to orlando. a longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. we arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. to add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us! uncomfortable claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style food cheap wine unacceptable and a waste of money.,no
no,"club europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in club europe - but for a 4 hour flight lgw to ace - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of ce with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. add to this limited luggage space think its easyjet with middle seat free for £600 more. is it worth it - no thinking avoid ba ce offering - shame i've a few flights to suffer yet. purser - ""this is it now - get used to it"" - service downhill too.",no
no,we travelled to and from europe in business class for a two week mediterranean cruise. we upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. my first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. the seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. the food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). upon our return we awaited in london heathrow terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. it finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite c - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. she did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. well i am here to tell all - don't pay the money. there is little to no difference in first class. the seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and i still felt like a second class citizen. this time i think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. to tell you the truth if i had paid for this upgrade i would have been upset as i don't believe this is up to par. we also did a connector flight from venice to london on the saturday. the airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. when we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. when we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. the last part is not fully ba's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). all in all i don't believe i will ever fly ba again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).,no
no,business class from shanghai to london. it was the worst business class. staff give the impression that they are above service and i did not feel that they were courteous or polite. on one occasion i asked for a glass of champagne and never got one on another occasion when i dropped my fork for the meal and buzzed for another one no one came when i tried to grab the attention of the staff member walking past he said sorry sir i'll be right with you and never came. eventually i just went to the back and grabbed one. i would never fly ba again for the money you pay you can get much better business class and value from other airlines.,yes
no,paphos - lgw 11th june. we had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from ba to confirm this. we arrived at paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. ba had 3 check in counters open one of which was for club europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. we had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. i then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. after 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. the food options were ok but again not a great choice for veggies. the flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. we were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. overall just an ok flight but ba's premier european product is somewhat underwhelming.,yes
no,bkk to lhr in club world 777-200 seat 3e and 3f on june 12th. we fly ba a lot and the service can be a bit hit and miss but this flight has been our best flight ever with ba great food and plenty of it nice choice of wine well stocked club kitchen for snacks but it was the crew that made this flight outstanding - from the start a real credit to ba.,yes
no,recently travelled lhr to san francisco and returned via las vegas flight ba0264. some years since doing long haul and forget how tiring it can be. flight out was 'ok' but return not so. outbound spoilt by an hour or so delay when boarded as they decided to change one of the wheels glad they did though. return yesterday not so good as flight again delayed by about one and a half hours but no real explanation. i realise people want to sleep but they can be so inconsiderate at times. no sooner in their seats and fully reclined. meal was just adequate curried chicken but breakfast of a very hard croissant with jam a nutty bar some dried cranberries and coffee was not what i really wanted after a delayed 9 hour flight. entertainment had good choices but sound quality was poor. boarding process in las vegas was rather shambolic. will still try and 'fly the flag' again.,no
no,lhr-belfast-lhr over a weekend. ground staff and flight attendants very professional and friendly. excellent announcements from the cockpit due to weather related delay outbound. seats on board a319 very comfortable. why save a penny by eliminating napkins with beverages? very cheap indeed. the 55 minute flight both ways went quickly. generous with drinks and the snacks were satisfactory (try the low cost competitors). ba is ideal for short haul flights within the uk and to/from continental europe.,no
no,i flew lhr-yvr outwards 20th may 2014 on 747. the cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th june 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. the whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the tv set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do ba sell these seats. i would be unlikely to book 1st class again with ba unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.,no
no,lgw - paphos 4th june. check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. as we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. the lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. the food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. my wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. after a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. no pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. the crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. my wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed fa said she could have hers. it was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. i was told that there was only one option left for me and i could have kedgeree or kedgeree so that's what i had. it was ok but not particularly hot. arrived at paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. overall the flight was just ok although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. my wife did receive an email from ba within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.,no
no,lhr-ewr rtn econ/premium. very good experience as usual with ba. having gone through the highly pleasurable t5 it was all aboard a 2 week old dreamliner for the 7 hour outbound flight. seats pretty comfortable for economy and new entertainment system very good indeed. return in premium economy wasn't bad at all comfortable enough to sleep the duration of the return flight. cabin crew professional and attentive in both directions. will be using the service again next month.,yes
no,ba11 lhr-sin 11 june. this flight and the reciprocal one from singapore to london in economy a month ago have restored my faith in ba. the aircraft was clean and in good condition; seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite and efficient. meals were of a good standard toilets were clean and properly maintained throughout the flight. boarding and disembarking were seamless from ba's side. one of the best flights i have had for years on many different carriers.,yes
no,lhr to dxb 11 jun 14 club world upper deck 64a - great flight slight delay of ten mins but excellent crew on the upper deck. food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time ba looked at returning to molton brown which was a lot superior than the elimis range. otherwise a great flight met by special services on arrival in dxb who whisked me through immigration and customs within 20 mins of landing which exceeded all expectations.,yes
no,flew from edinburgh to new york via lhr on 5th and 10 june. all flights were very full but the service from check in to on board were very good. my only complaint was the breakfast on the return flight a croissant jam and tea or coffee which was very disappointing.,yes
no,outbound ba 175 12/5/14. return ba 286 1/6/14. recently travelled economy on long haul to nyc and returned from san francisco having previously done long haul with virgin. ba knocks virgin into a cocked hat. love ba. keep flying the flag!,yes
no,osl-lhr june 8th. two days after arriving i departed still less my check-in bag from june 6th. flight delayed this is more often than not on most ba flights i have been on. food offered in economy same chicken tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. i would rather have the option to buy something i might want to eat. cabin crew brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but it's the only reason they have any customers.,yes
no,ba 213 lhr to boston. t5 was very busy but check in was fast and efficient. the flight was on a 747 the aircraft was clean but looking dated. we were seated to the rear of the aircraft. the food choice was ok but both meals had curried options fine if you like curry but limiting if you don't. lucky for us there was still a choice. my tv was broken so i had a long 6.5 hours. the flight crew were very helpful and happy.,yes
no,flew world traveller plus for the first time. our trip was to and from lhr from toronto yyz. when flying a distance world traveller plus is well worth the little extra. being a big guy - tall - i really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. and the on-board staff were super. will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at heathrow on friday june 6th. we made it back to toronto ok but our luggage was just delivered to our house today wednesday june 11th. i guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. i'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. all-in-all i will definitely fly british airways again.,yes
no,glasgow to lhr on a completely full flight. the crew were amazing despite being provoked by an extremely rude lady who was sitting at the emergency exit seat they remained calm and professional despite her rude and obnoxious comments. departed on time and landed early which is always nice.,yes
no,lhr-cph-lhr both a320s. other than bussed to stand on the outward all was very good. the bus is unexpected at a 'new' terminal but the warmth of the welcome from the crew cheered you up a lot! simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. the return was a tad delayed due local atc but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as i reached the carousel. advance booking and using a few points (some i earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers. with ba renewing it's fleet the a/c seemed almost new and all very enjoyable.,yes
no,rome fiumicino - lhr jun 1st economy airbus 321. great staff food offering poor i would have been happy to pay for a better option.,no
no,the outward trip manchester - heathrow - milan was fine with even a guide to take us to our connection at lhr terminal 5. the return trip munich - heathrow - manchester was not so good. the system would not let me check-in online and despite being the first in the queue at airport check-in we had already been allocated seats right at the back (we discovered on boarding - no plan or explanation given on check-in) with no recline. both planes were late and at heathrow especially the communication was poor: at one point the board said 'please wait' then there was a 'last call' even though the gate had not yet opened; the staff seemed unconcerned at the delay no explanation or apology were offered unless they were in the inaudible announcement but i doubt it as it was quite short. having arrived at munich to check in at 1.30pm we eventually got to manchester at 9pm not too late as the pilot made up some of the lost time (all excellent pilots by the way). but during this time the only refreshments were a small packet of crisps and a drink twice. not impressive although the staff on board were friendly and polite.,no
no,lhr to dxb return. outbound flight delayed 2 hours just as well as it took over an hour to clear security. remote lounge quiet nice food and wine. jumbo on way out new interior new and very good entertainment excellent attentive crew food as usual poor - (recommend you always eat at the airport which given cost of flight one really shouldn't have to). inbound flight on a 777. same on way back as on way in except also on time but must commend 2 crew members for their endless patience with one clown of a passenger.,yes
no,we flew lax to lhr on the new a380-800 in club world. flight was on time. the flight attendants were pleasant. food was excellent. there was a huge choice of movies to watch. the lie-flat seats were very comfortable. i am definitely going to fly british airways again.,no
no,lhr-lax-lhr. this route is the new a380 which i was very much looking forward to travelling on it certainly did not disappoint. i paid £20 extra to reserve seats in the upper deck at the very back this area is only 4 rows separated by galley and toilets and really does feel like its own private cabin. plus the seating on the upper deck in a 2-4-2 layout means sitting by the window not only feels more spacious as you only have 1 person next to you but due to the shape of the a380 you get huge amounts of shoulder room and access to little storage lockers below the window. flew virgin uc on my last trip to la in a tired and dated aircraft and ba economy was welcome. can not recommend ba enough.,no
no,"we just flew round trip on the new a380 from lax to lhr (and then on to rome). the a380 business class area was nice and the food was decent. however the layout of the seats wasn't great (you have to jump over the person next to you when they have their seat in a flat position). also avoid the aisle seats as you feel like you're out in the open and people are constantly bustling by. as well the seats on the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under your seat. the ba lounge in lax was ok nothing great (although the food was decent) and their south lounge in lhr terminal 5 was just ok - very busy and crammed with people. nowhere to relax and enjoy some downtime. the food was the worst we've ever experienced in a lounge (only things available were horrible little sandwiches a few cookies and drinks. since lhr is the hub for ba we expected way more. however our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights. they were highly erratic in quality. some were very friendly and helpful others were beyond rude. i had read that british air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis. there are apparently a lot of ""floaters"" who come and go and work different flights by choice. to me this seems like a big mistake and most likely causes the huge discrepancy in service. our flight home was an hour late (ba seems to be late a lot based on the many reviews). they also managed to lose all of our luggage. we travel a lot and will no longer choose british airways as it's too much of a ""russian roulette"" as to whether your service will be good or not.",yes
no,"we travelled club europe from gatwick to paphos as we were going out to get married. the extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. as it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on club europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didn't really benefit from that. the lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. we were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the club europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment i had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. the seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what i'd have expected. our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. i don't know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid i think we were entitled to have higher expectations. not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. we'd never travel club europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday!",no
no,lhr-ath-lhr outbound 6th june. check in and lounge good as normal at t5' boarding done by bus which i always find odd at the home hub seat 3a on an a320 i like ba's club europe and this flight was no different. nice happy crew and the food english breakfast was pretty good flight arrived on time bags off quickly. return 9th june check in at ath airport quick and polite used the lounge which is ok but pretty full with 2 flights leaving about an hour apart. boarding quick seat 2a and another a320 appeared a bit older but comfortable enough for a 3hr30min flight crew again friendly meal service was lunch which was ok arrival t5 on time and on a gate this time. i read some reviews on here i've travelled a lot with many airlines in economy premium economy business and first have to say my experience with ba has been mostly very positive. everyone can have an off day.,no
no,london (lhr) to houston (iah) to london (lhr). t5 in heathrow is crazy we been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. we got boarding first then people comes in the plane. when the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. the seat was uncomfortable old and tired. the cabin crew were so miserable.,no
no,travelling from venice to london gatwick with british airways on what should have been a painless short flight (2hrs). how wrong i was. held in boarding queue for about 20 minutes with no explanation. then got onto flight to find no crew to help passengers in economy with on-boarding stowing luggage etc. i was sat in very last row and became apparent that the crew were sat at the back having a laugh. a large number of the passengers on this flight were elderly requiring help putting their hand baggage in the overhead lockers. did the crew bother to look or help? no. they were sat up the back in the galley having a right old laugh. only when we started taxi-ing could they be bothered to finish their chat and do a lacklustre safety demonstration. which i couldn't see as the crew member demonstrating was right at the front of the plane. i couldn't hear the pilot announcement as the audio was faulty. no idea what he said or what flight conditions were. for a nervous passenger this is not great. took off and then the crew started for service. the food i couldn't eat as allergic to one of the ingredients and told there was no other option. fair enough. was offered a drink about 20 mins before landing. just as well i had my own water i guess. finally crew member opened locker above my head on approach and her shoe fell out on my head. wasn't painful per say but didn't get apology from crew member at all. she looked at me like it was my fault! i fly ba quite a bit and usually never much of an issue. i found the service on this flight incredible really. i'm still pinching myself to think it was actually ba. i left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed if this is now the standard product from ba. the plane was old no map torn seats broken arm rests and rubbish in- flight service. i really will now try to find other airlines for both uk and international flights from now on where-ever possible.,yes
no,"lhr-vie on an a319. online check-in didn't start working until about 15 hours before the flight. selected 13f on a very full flight. selected ""collect at the airport"" option. suddenly 8e a middle seat. no aircraft swap no explanation no apology. boarding pass failed to work at security an error somewhere in the system told security that pass had already been used allegedly before i even got to the airport. boarding not great with a packed bus getting a tour of t3. flight 15 mins late due to congestion at lhr. service efficient but not overly friendly. much prefer austrian on this route and will return to them for my next trip. a shame as ba should be a world beater - i'd not flown with them for about a year and it bought back memories as to why i choose others.",yes
no,lhr-sin in business on b-747. hard to find much good to say about this experience. everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. heathrow t5 a complete overcrowded mess. flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. and to make it all worse ba had a global baggage it systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). the flight itself was average at best. upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired ife limited food appalling. the only positive thing i can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. can't imagine how ba can compete with sq on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. they have no idea where my bag is or when i will get it and you can't contact ba in singapore on the weekend as they are closed. one just gets the impression they couldn't care less. would not recommend.,yes
no,lhr to bos. day after baggage shut down but first check in easy and security quiet. super breakfast in concorde room. flight then delayed for 2 hours whilst all on board but crew were great. food and wine superb and service was ba at it's very best.,no
no,lhr-arn. all the procedures at heathrow terminal 5 were a breeze. there was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional. the flight went on an old dirty and worn out a319 though seats were comfortable. the service was of typical intra european flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were professional. overall i would use ba in the future but i would prefer flying a newer plane next time.,no
no,lgw to ams. easy check-in at gatwick with the pods to check in and print boarding pass. did that the night before as staying at an airport hotel. easy and quick to drop off bag. departure lounge easy to find. controlled boarding. pleasant staff and light snack on short flight. well recommended and far better to use than t5 at lhr if you have the choice. luggage took a long time to arrive at ams but that is schipol's issue rather than ba.,no
no,i really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too (and from) vegas was with ba however i can categorically state i will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. highlights of my journey include: severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (no beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). uninterested and incompetent staff. lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). space reduced to less than a foot (head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. i could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when i say that i am an easy customer to please. if you have virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. ba operate as a (poor) budget airline posing as something else. very poor journey shocking experience.,yes
no,flew in club world for the first time on the new ba a380s. big disappointment. the two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. the dinner service on the lhr-jnb flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). the staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. all this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. the cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. a pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth.,yes
no,lhr-ath-ath june 2014. both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane (767) used on this particular flight. food average cabin crew variable-average overall. no apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptable-ba still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. poor overall and am even considering using easyjet as gatwick closer to my home.,no
no,sao paulo - london heathrow club world. sat in the upper deck on the 747. fantastic experience. very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. reasonable food good selection of drinks and good ife.,yes
no,travelled from barbados to london gatwick and then onwards to italy using british airways in both instances. returned to gatwick on may 28 and again travelled by ba to barbados. my experience in all instances was extremely positive. the flight crew on all flights accommodated my every request. the food was served at the right temperature at appropriate intervals and was tasty. i would definitely use this airline again.,yes
no,lhr to bkk in club world over night flight. lounge at t5 great. nice choice of hot foods wines and snacks. love the spa treatments. i really like the club world seats very private for sleeping. food tasty had mushroom pasta. good choice of films. most of crew in club did a great job still get the odd one here and there that are surly and disinterested - make you feel as if they are doing you a favour! i always try and fly ba on the whole a great airline.,yes
no,flew yvr to muc via lhr. i had high expectations for this airline but was pretty disappointed. we were flying with twin 15 month olds so it's great with ba that you can preselect the bassinet spots when booking. crew did bare minimum seemed as though asking for anything was a huge inconvenience. audio on ife was awful couldn't hear any movies. flight landed 10 minutes late in london and we were denied boarding on the muc flight due to being late. if they allow a connection of 1h10 and you're 10 minutes late and can't get on their system is flawed. when are any lhr flights not 10 mins late! they rebooked us 2.5 hours later but after complaining put us on a lufthansa flight 1 hour later. i never thought i would say this but will use air canada on this route from now on if the price is equal.,no
no,mct-lhr-man and lhr-mct i think you need to fly ba every so often to remind yourself why you don't do it any more. the first flight was just poor - from check in to landing. although they have now changed the aircraft on this route and the ife is better they still treat the passengers as self-loading cargo. it took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything. a full flight and at least one washroom out of action was an additional pain. transit through lhr is always an unalloyed joy and this time i had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this i still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff. lhr to man was fine. coming back was much better the crew were responsive and pro-active and the food was actually edible - if all ba flights were like this i would use them more - i only used them this time because swiss have axed the route temporarily while the work on the dubai runway is happening.,yes
no,boeing 777. one of our best flights from europe. everything was done to make us comfortable including showing the technically challenged how to work the numerous controls. good selection of movies and shows. food and wine selection was good and the prep was quite good. seat was very good especially compared to the 747 outbound flight we had.,no
no,tampa-gatwick. check in lousy. i can't believe i am writing this. checking in 3 bags one weighed 32.7 kg the supervisor insisted i remove the .7kg (1lb) from the bag. i had to ask him if he was serious and he said he was. the person checking in next to me had the same problem. when you fly business class the reason you do is because you don't want stress this strictness doesn't help. tampa airport didn't help the stress level either i had one carry on bag rucksack and a small bag for a laptop security to the gate insisted i was allowed two carry on's so i had to put two bags into one. going through the third security the scanner showed i had something in my pocket. body search revealed i had a few $ notes in my pocket. security man 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything' i thought he was joking he wasn't. lounge at tampa ok. sandwiches freshly made and plenty of drinks reasonable space. option of going to one world lounge as well. boarding aircraft clean all seats in club taken offered champagne by very friendly cabin crew. food usual just edible (insulting to passengers as you are paying business class monies) flight landed late. baggage collection happy to see two of my check in's come out first and sad to see the last bag come out last as the priority tag had got removed of the last bag.,yes
no,a long time user of ba i have seen a gradual decline in quality now hit freefall and the lhr-phx-lhr route that i use monthly has become more akin to sitting in a cattle truck than a b747. old airframes with tatty interiors are the norm legroom is extremely limited the aircraft is seldom what you would call clean and the crews give the impression they are almost putting themselves out to serve you. food is not worthy of the name and the whole experience is an utterly miserable 10 hours of your life each leg. enough is enough and 1st june is the last time i'll use the outbound flight as i'm switching across to united via ord in future. ok it means a changeover in chicago but the recent experience was a refreshing change from ba and i actually felt like i was wanted on the united flights.,no
no,lhr-warsaw. economy on an a320. plane seemed brand new. was seated in 8c towards the front of economy and that's obviously a seat that gets configured for club europe from time to time as the seat pitch was pretty generous. complimentary breakfast consisting of coffee and a filled croissant was perfectly ok. service efficient. flight left and landed on time. textbook stuff really. no complaints at all.,yes
no,gatwick to malaga late may. i have travelled this route literally hundreds of times the number of airlines that have or currently operate this route over the years gives a good choice of flight times and fares. however i find myself using ba as the norm. the flights are well priced usually on time the aircraft are clean and comfortable although they could be newer. legroom is great especially if you can bag a seat in the first eight rows these have 34 inches of legroom. organised boarding makes a huge positive difference as well.,yes
no,"travelled back from tampa to gatwick friday 30th may. this flight proved that it is the crew that make a good or bad flight. this one was really bad. i was booked in club normally the plane is a three class 777. on friday it was a four class that was flying and i was lucky enough to be seated in the first class cabin. although it was not classed as an upgrade to first because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words i heard as being offered a drink was - ""can't wait for this flight to be over"". this was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. i hope ba read this forum as the service really was appalling. my husband was in the bathroom when breakfast was served he was ignored. a request of a cup of coffee was met with we will be landing in 40 minutes. so what should have been a real treat turned out to be the most disappointed i have ever been with ba. will no longer recommend.",yes
no,i flew from london to milan linate on 27th may 2014. firstly the booking process was quick and easy and was matched by an efficient check-in and bag drop procedure too. the staff were well turned out and other than one cabin crew member the cabin staff were professional and polite. the airbus was modern and comfortable. a snack and drink was served on this flight and it was nice to see screen showing the route map of the flight. disembarkation was orderly and well managed. i hope to use ba again the in the near future.,yes
no,dublin to sydney (via heathrow and singapore). club europe from dublin to london and club world to sydney. flight to heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. upon arrival in heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. by this time it was about 10pm. obviously missed the connecting flight to sydney so tried to find a ba contact in terminal 4. was then advised to go to terminal 1. no ba reps around and no 24 hr phone number. then transferred to terminal 5. by this time it was midnight and still no ba contacts. finally went to baggage services and saw a ba rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by ba they provided us with the option of flying back to sydney on ba or could see if they could get us on a china southern flight (we had originally booked china southern). we took the ba option as it was easiest and needed to come home. next day arrived at airport and boarded through gate c in terminal 5 (hate heathrow airport). lounge in heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. upon boarding the ba business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. we had the two middle seats e and f which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. flight left on time and arrived in singapore on time. there was a delay of an hour in singapore but again that couldn't be helped. they were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. seats were small and very uncomfortable. the amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. the hit towels were anything but hot. food was below average. overall i wouldn't recommend british airways club europe/world. the best i've experienced so far from sydney to europe would have to be on china southern. considering they are 2-3 grand cheaper than british airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process.,yes
no,belfast city to london heathrow on 30th may 2014. i travelled in economy class on this domestic flight across the irish sea. the flight experience with ba started with a pleasant check-in agent who made sure i knew where i was going to and was then equalled by well groomed and friendly cabin crew. a small drink and a biscuit was offered on this route. the captain kept the passengers informed of the route and arrival was on time and disembarkation swift. my only complaint was that the announcement in belfast was not clear and was made by somebody who was hard to understand.,no
no,ba 214 in the late spring os a 747-400. lie-flat seats were ok but still difficult to sleep on. seats alternated between face-front and face-rear so when the privacy screen is down you are looking directly at the other person. service was fine with an optional dinner and breakfast and a variety of drinks. snack basket was available all night. business class was nice but not sure it is worth the extra cost.,yes
no,"boeing 767 club europe to istanbul and back. the seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. the head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. the food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. even though i know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. crew much better inbound.",yes
no,gatwick-tampa. check in simple lounge at gatwick average aircraft b777. clean and departed on time. on board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4k window you won't disturb anyone getting out. but have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. anyone booking business as opposed to eco or eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in eco. good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. brought my own in ear bose iq20 headset excellent for flights.,yes
no,my husband and i travelled to san diego from heathrow and back via jfk five weeks later. service is appalling. stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to san diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. the journey from jfk was worse. same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. we paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. the problem is staff. there needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.,no
no,i found ba to be the worst airline i have used. flew lhr to boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. it had the interior of an old knackered plane. i have flown singapore airlines who run rings around this bunch. i could have flown with virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience.,yes
no,"heathrow - johannesburg a380. my first flight on a380. after half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. first thing i noticed was how tiny the seats were. second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. there were grease stains and empty cans left behind. at this point i noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. when asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. anyhow time for lift off. i turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. after looking for 5 minutes i couldn't find it anywhere. (later i found out there is no such option on ba a380s). so no tail cam fine let's listen to some music. wrong the headphones are not working. cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me some more"". one hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. i've managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. and if that was not enough it was time for dinner. by the time it was my turn ba had run out of ""chicken"" so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. you don't even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the ""chicken"". so no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until i could get off this plane. the worst part is i have a return trip with ba which i'll be looking to switch to another airline if possible.",no
no,i flew on apr 29 to belfast changing in heathrow and also may 6th from belfast to (via heathrow) barcelona then may 17 from venice - heathrow) then to vancouver bc. i was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. the only part was that changing at heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.,no
no,heathrow - johannesburg. concorde lounge comfortable as always. a little underwhelmed at first by first class on the a380 not as spacious or appealing as i had expected. however it had all that i needed including a very good screen for the ife. had the 5-course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding. unfortunately arrived at same time as several other long-haul flights so immigration was a pain but not much ba can do about that.,yes
no,ba heathrow to madrid club euro. disappointing service perfunctory at best with cabin crew spending much of the flight hiding behind their curtain. full cabin but it has to be questioned why we continue to pay extra when the service is so disappointing. flight itself was fine cabin itself not as tatty as some ba short haul. good experience at t5 lounge at heathrow. the afternoon tea product continues to underwhelm and underfeed - they really should change this.,yes
no,club europe london heathrow t3 to lisbon. t3 lounge very good. boarding fine and helpful but it is disappointing that this flight consistently requires a bus to link the terminal to the plane and that there is no specific service for club europe passengers. there is little point in fast tracking us at other stages of the journey to ignore us at this point. good flight excellent cabin crew - why can't ba have a consistency of cabin crew quality? today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent with their service throughput the flight. food was fine champagne improved from previous flights. quality of cabin still modest - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but i fear that ba's focus is on the long haul not those of us who travel within europe. efficient upon arriving at lisbon.,no
no,txl-lhr-sfo. txl-lhr on an a321 it was an uneventful flight drinks were served. transfer at heathrow was uneventful but i think that ba should give their gate numbers beforehand. lhr-sfo on boeing 747-400. ife was a little old and the volume was very low. movie selection was okay. overall it was a pleasant journey.,yes
no,"san diego return business class (the seat was more comfortable than the first class one). as usual plane was fine service was ok but not attentive (i.e just about ok). food was terrible -i have flown ba in economy business and first - and never had good or adequate quality food. if they upped their game on this they would be unbeatable. entertainment pretty dire - at least first had a few good ""box sets"" of tv programmes. my wife was back in economy - her comment was that the world traveller plus seat gave her backache - the economy seat was better. her food was inedible.",no
no,london heathrow to madrid on a boeing 767-300. the outward flight was on a plane configured for worldwide operation. i.e. with club world world traveller plus and world traveller classes. it was one of the newly refurbished ones. the economy cabin at 2-3-2 and leg room was excellent - i am 6 foot tall. snack of a very nice chicken sandwich complimentary alcoholic drinks with a second run. staff very efficient and friendly. we are silver members of the exec club and the cabin service director welcomed us by name. on time departure and slightly early arrival. the return flight was on a standard european configured aircraft but space was as good as the outward journey. on time departure and arrived into heathrow 20 minutes early. overall a great trip.,yes
no,flew british airways from sydney to venice on 22nd april and return 20th may from barcelona. from sydney check in staff wonderful courteous and helpful. cabin crew just as wonderful as check in staff. food out of sydney awful. return journey was from barcelona. again check in staff were wonderful and helpful. cabin crew just as wonderful and food was fine.,no
no,recently returned from mauritius to gatwick in club world and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. left on time. the cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. a little round casserole dish of british breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. awful insipid coffee. after that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted i rang for a drink and nobody came. the galley 'kitchen/snack bar' was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. on asking for a glass (there were none) for wine i was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. throughout the flight i felt guilty asking for a g&t or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. lunch was just about ok and very good wine. after that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. the seating configuration was 2-4-2 (boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. to access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. we were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. the ife was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. the whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. if there is an alternative in future to ba i'll take it and compared with some middle-east airlines the club world product is embarrassingly mediocre. ba needs to refresh review and up-date quickly. sorry ba - you've lost me for the foreseeable future!,yes
no,london to barbados and back. after reading some bad reviews we were delighted with the service and food and both ways we had a great crew. shame the films were not on demand on the return trip.,yes
no,recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a ba promo to fly in to singapore and then to hong kong via cathay pacific and back to uk. our flight out to singapore was easy and relaxed because i think it was not a busy flight. we did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. the canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. we understand ba has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. our flight on cathay pacific to hong kong was great! we were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. on our way back to london we were excited as we knew we were flying the a380. sq and emirates have a380 we have flown. this turned out to be a mistake from the start. when we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. when we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the ba a380 were in comparison to sq or even emirates. next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. the staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. the ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. by the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. no apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! i was quite upset by now as i had to ask the stewardess what was being served. i have never felt more humiliated. with ba it was just silence. miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. no smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! our overall flying experience with ba has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals. it had just served as a reminder why i have not chosen ba the last 10 years and perhaps the next 10 to come.,no
no,lgw-antigua on 29 april and antigua-lgw on 13 may boeing 777. it started off badly when i went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 february. the system rejected both my credit and debit cards. on checking the state of my account with ba online i found that the final payment had been credited to my account and i now owed the initial deposit. i sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. first call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of english. another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. i was told it had been sorted out and received e ticket email with my state of account showing i owed nothing. two weeks later i received another e ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. next credit card statement did not show money taken out. not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. two weeks before flight i got a phone call from ba stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. i then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. about 22 hours before flight i went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. arrived at lgw to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. we then had to queue to drop off baggage. other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. flight left and arrived on time. however the inflight main meal was the worst i have ever experienced on an aircraft. there was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. the inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to singapore in 1962 was better. on return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. check in at antigua was one of the quickest check ins i have ever done. left antigua on time and arrived lgw on time. food was worse than going out. no choice. starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. white wine was just about drinkable. coffee served as we started main course. asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. no turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. at least with ryanair you know what you get for your money.,yes
no,lhr-jtr-lhr. a tale of opposites for ba's new route to santorini. outward it couldn't have been better with excellent fas decent food and arrival that was ahead of schedule. the return started off poorly with substandard facilities at santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding. an air traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. on board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind. the club europe toilet then ran out of water. so overall okay but the return was disappointing.,no
no,gatwick-venice return. two contrasting experiences. trip out pretty good a320 so much better than the old 737's used at gatwick. staff friendly and a good snack and beverage included. good updates from cabin and we left and arrived on time. trip back felt like it had been crewed by brand new staff in the cabin. food handed out 20 mins after take-off but drinks took another 30 mins to be offered around cabin. half the cabin crew seemed too pre-occupied with passengers not sitting in correct seat even though flight not full. think a smile and re-assurance to move back after take-off would have sorted the issue however one female crew member in particular had forgotten to bring her 'happy face' to work that day! flight ok but not up to standard you expect. i fly ba quite regularly and choose over easyjet as fares and flight times often similar but service superior. i hope the gatwick service levels can reflect the ba brand otherwise they have an aggressive competitor in ej at this airport.,no
no,1st class lhr-phx. totally seamless flight. great driver collection through concierge service (granted it was extra). concorde room was lovely great staff and nice breakfast. first class service onboard staff were very good. producing a very nice custom meal for my wife.,yes
no,when we booked our holiday to barbados i was really pleased to see we were flying with british airways as they have a good reputation. sadly our experiences put a lie to this. as part of the service they offer ba allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. i tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. after a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of english wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. i rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of english was still unable to assist in any way. both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the airport. so in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. we entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. by now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! we then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. as they were free i don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? i have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. sadly british airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. the legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat i had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. as my tv screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. i managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so i was forced to stop. i would love to see what regulations ba have to follow regarding vdu viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. the final disappointment came when the food was distributed. i had the thai chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. she didn't eat hers. i ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. all in all this was an experience i do not want to repeat and i shall certainly not fly british airways by choice in the future! we didn't have these problems with sri lanka airlines.,yes
no,travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from london to boston i hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. i had not paid to reserve my seat as i had never had to pay extra before while flying with emirates singapore or cathay pacific. the seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (a/b/c). my wife sat with the kids while i had to sit in the row behind. the seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. it seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. i warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. i had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. on the return flight i reluctantly paid extra (£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. the journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra £23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). my wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. in conclusion i found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. it seems the flight services to usa are not up to the same standard as flying to the middle east or the far east as british airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the usa was with american airlines and that was worse than ba. the main disappointing issue with ba is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. if you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra £200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of ryanair!,no
no,lcy-snn-jfk-lcy ba001 and 004. quick check in and fast track security although i had to show my boarding pass to get expedited. gate 24 lounge with a view of our aircraft and a glass of champagne. quick boarding nice welcome by a familiar face. cabin has stood up well and is as fresh as it was on introduction. starter choice to shannon now replaced by a selection of canapes served on a plate. usa immigration straight forward and soon back on the aircraft but the airport is soulless. once in the air salad drinks and a choice of mains. i had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered in chocloate sauce - bliss. later on the friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve supper rather than afternoon tea. this was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.tasty.quick disembarkation lovely crew. return on 004 sunday evening supper in the busy galleries dining room. then quick boarding on this full 31/32 flight. supper served to those who wanted it and then a full hot english breakfast option or a bag to go. bussed to the arrivals hall and immigration and then home in 15 minutes. excellent crew and flight.,yes
no,mia-lhr in world traveller on a 747-400. after having flown 3 consecutive legs on aa (and having been pleasantly surprised) i wasn't sure how an old ba 747 would measure up but aircraft was spotless and in full working order. crew were friendly and helpful. the food was pretty good and the ife far better than aa.,yes
no,flew to vegas on 8th may and dismayed at the standard. filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. the worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.,no
no,on a recent vacation from sacramento to paris some friends and i had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from paris to sacramento. we did however choose british airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. i am happy to report that the experience was totally different. our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. on the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. we also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. their screen was so far ahead i couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. the staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. i will definitely recommend british airways for international flights to my friends.,yes
no,i should be in a nice hotel in romania instead 9 hours after i arrived in heathrow courtesy of british airways i am still in heathrow heading back to glasgow! the 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from glasgow to london. the connecting flight to bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant i wouldn't get my connecting flight to timisoara. i duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. they offered to put me up in a hotel in bucharest but were not able to book one. having waited 50 mins at a ba desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in bucharest i was not filled with confidence. since i was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting i decided to go back to glasgow. i was booked on the 15.50 to glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. told my boarding pass was sorted. they hadn't sorted it and i got a lecture about what i needed to do in future. there was no way i was getting on the flight told that i should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!,no
no,2/5/2014 bru-lhr-jfk. short flight in business from brussels to heathrow was how a short business always has to be: excellent crew decent food flight was on time. flight from lhr to jfk started in perfect conditions: first lounge in terminal 5 (as a gold member) with excellent champagne and food and place. boarding was smooth with helpful crew a nice drink to welcome us on board and to relax and a nice smile. in one word the start of a perfect flight in a full cabin landing on time in new york. this is how it always should be.,yes
no,while different people have different experiences i wanted to share that i have mixed reviews both are great - one can be used as feedback while the other for pat on ba's backs! i was traveling blr-lhr-sfo route on 9th of may 2014. the first flight from blr-lhr was chaotic and as mentioned by others on this site most food options were exhausted by the end of the flight. i don't complain because i got my food choice. the flight staff had some really courteous people while some were pretty snobbish. the second flight is really what's worth mentioning - it was the most cheerful flight i have been on! the flight attendants were entertaining the pains of being on a second leg of a 24 hr journey was not felt. ba 287 flying on 9th may 2014 - fantastic flight. food was okay - i loved the lily o brien chocolate mousse! entertainment - its high time ba upgrades its entertainment systems. the audio was lousy and nothing was clear or audible even on the highest volume against the aircraft sounds.,yes
no,once again a good flight from lhr to warsaw in an a320. cabin crew were very efficient and friendly on both outbound and inbound flights. i was tempted to upgrade for £72 when i booked the flights but decided not to due to the good catering service on the flight and the shortish journey. the wraps have been replaced by a flat bread sandwich which is much better! looking forward to my next flight!,yes
no,lgw-mru-lgw in business. outbound flight good with attentive staff return flight staff couldn't seem to care less had to ask for everything even water and coffee after lunch. not what you expect in club world from a 4 star carrier.,yes
no,lhr-fra-lcy may 2014. lhr-fra on a 767 row 18. checked-in via the mobile app no bags to drop as a day trip. ba galleries south for a quick spot of breakfast. boarding started 20 minutes before departure. not a full flight. left slightly late due to cargo being loaded but arrived on time. standard seating and food for ba short haul european flight. return fra-lcy on a e70 row 15. use of the jal lounge at fra opposite the gate area. bus to the aircraft and an on-time departure. full flight and not much room up above for carry on items on this aircraft on a full flight. legroom quite tight in row 15. again standard food and drink for a ba short haul service.,yes
no,rating : 10/10 cabin flown economy value for money seat comfort staff service catering entertainment recommended,no
no,08/5/2014 jfk-lhr-bru. after the perfect outbound flight we thought that the inbound flight could not be the same. the lounge is jfk was very crowded and not really relaxed. boarding was again relaxed with a perfect crew on the upper deck friendly and relaxed. slept nearly the all flight in perfect conditions. the flight lhr-bru was delayed with more than 40 minutes but the captain excused humbly for the delay and gave us plenty of information. business cabin was full but the service on this short flight was more than excellent.,yes
no,belfast-heathrow-frankfurt return. very impressed with the service and crew especially on the frankfurt-heathrow sections as the belfast ones are only domestic but still excellent. i was impressed with the food which was a hot chicken dinner going out and afternoon tea on the return leg. the crew were really exceptional and make this airline as the seat pitch in club europe is poor. their galleries lounge in t5 is just ok being a bit of a cattle market compared to the sukara longge in frankfurt which was superb.,yes
no,caught a connection from gatwick to jersey and it was fine. a very short flight with very efficient and effective staff. not much more i can say because we were up and out so quickly. i was travelling business and it is about time a little more space was made in the cabins. if you cannot cross your legs then why are you paying for business class seats?,yes
no,i have just been reviewing all the reviews on this website and it seems every evident to me that if you are booked in first class you will more than lightly have a great flight economy or premium is touch and go! if you want to take the risk i travel ba to tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and i always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well i complained! myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. the crew had kept these meals for themselves. so be aware that if you are seated in aisle 14 bring your own food because you will not get a decent meal.,no
no,flew from san francisco to heathrow london. flight was delayed 3.5 hours the food particularly the breakfast was the worst i've had on an airline. the sets were very uncomfortable. i feel ba have a long way to catch up to the quality to other airlines such as emirates and qatar.,no
no,i flew singapore to sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. at the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. the plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin i have seen. there was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. the seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. the inflight entertainment was a joke. the video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. the food was some strange fried rice which was bland. the crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. the worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. overall i will never fly british airways again unless i don't have any choice.,no
no,"lanzarote to gatwick on 13th april. flight itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the captain apologised). after a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. ba have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from ""start to finish"" but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. can't recommend ba because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. not planning to use ba again because of this.",no
no,lgw-vrn-lgw both in club europe. was offered an upgrade on the way out for £85. swift check-in as gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. used the galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. left slightly late due to congestion. nice breakfast with individual bottles of heidseck monopole champagne. no aerobridges at verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. bags delivered quickly. return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. ba use the catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! the lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal service-the chicken curry was passable.,yes
no,6 may 2014: las vegas to gatwick. boeing 777. back on ba again thanks to avios companion coupon. cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. i've flown af tap swiss klm long haul in the past year and by far ba catering in economy is the poorest in content. yesterdays offering for breakfast was almost an insult.,no
no,lhr-yyz in business was looking forward to a b787 but this flight was a b777. had the rear facing seat- comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. ife screen on the small side but managed one movie. crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.,yes
no,"i'm not normally one to whine but here goes. lhr-cdg at 0725 on a tuesday morning via the dreaded gate a10. plenty of ""fast track"" signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers! outstanding! flight ok (fairly grubby ex bd a320) but the pointlessness of a non fast fast track amused me no end.",yes
no,jfk to lhr. empty check in and priority security quick. new food selection in first class lounge but preferred the decent meal in the dining room. boarding easy and upper deck crew excellent as lights not turned on until just before descent with arrival on time. bus to terminal but bags waiting when we got there.,yes
no,chicago o'hare to london heathrow on 2 may. check in very fast and efficient. new 777 plane. take off and landing about 30 minutes late. friendly flight crew. efficient service. good vegetarian meal. very pleasant flight.,yes
no,travelled to hkg on board the new a380. boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for first passengers. welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. the space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. the food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. there are also treats available in the first galley. breakfast was also very good. i managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. the crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. the entertainment system was the thales product. plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. i couldn't fault this flight just a pity i couldn't spend longer on it. looking forward to the return journey.,yes
no,"ba 059 london to cape town april 29 2014 economy. it's been a while since i flew ba world traveller and it will be even longer until i use them again. clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system. - my partners failed. the crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the ""service"" note the quotes over with asap. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. perfunctory drinks service - when asking for a whisky and soda i was offered whisky and tonic. paper cups for coffee at breakfast. meals are better at a little chef. the amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. never again. wake up ba there are major competitors out there and next time it emirates via dubai.",no
no,las vegas-lgw 777 3 class. business. the unique forward facing/rear facing seat configuration fits in more seats than other leading airlines. try to get a window/aisle seat if you are travelling as a couple but you will be lucky unless you are prepared to pay £60 to choose your seat. otherwise you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited choices to change your seat allocation on a busy flight. in the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take off and landing or sat next to someone with a small partition between you. in all seats the foot rest is part of the bed and blocks access so you will either have to step over or be stepped over to leave your seat. the seats were comfortable in all positions. dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. breakfast was a disaster; hardly any of the choices on the menu were available but no explanation or apology were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants. we got a good price in a ba sale but the overall experience was disappointing.,no
no,an interesting contrast on recent gatwick to turin and back flights. going out it was a (new?) a320 which was bright clean and spacious. on the way back it was a b737 which was clean but a bit tatty and felt cramped. service food and drinks on both flights was commendable. i believe that all of ba's 737s retire by the end of the year which cannot come too soon.,yes
no,heathrow marrakech. had previously travelled on the british midland service with mixed results. things seem to have improved since the take-over and integration of services. staff more attentive both on the ground and inflight. meals seem to have improved too. there has been a real lack of choice on this route (still is) but hopefully the improvement will be consistent.,yes
no,business lhr to bkk. 747-400. first try back with ba in about 5 years during which i have flown many other airlines and been impressed with most. the only things that impress me with ba are the staff and their ability to pretend this is a quality airline and the fact that people pay ba so much money to be treated like cattle. the food is without doubt some of the worst i have had in business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. the avod looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasn't the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. the seats work well as a lie flat configuration. that's the highlight. i cant help feel that if ba senior managers occasionally used their own money to fly with rivals then we would see real change from our national flag carrier. regretting my already booked return flight and my 550000 ba air miles.,yes
no,"this was a bmi regional operated flight on a rj145 from manchester to heathrow - but with a ba flight number so i have to report it on here. on boarding the cabin crew member didn't look up to check our boarding passes or welcome us. no check on seatbelts etc. prior to takeoff. the service started soon after takeoff since this was a very short flight this consisted of a trolley with drinks and snacks - as is usual on ba domestic services. there were 5 men in front of me returning from a weekend break who were given 2 gin and tonics each and the cabin steward was very friendly with them. he got to me and stared i stared back i took it he had forgotten to say ""may i offer you something from the bar"" or something similar. i asked for an orange juice and that is exactly what was thrust onto my tray. i asked for ice i got one lump splashed into my juice reluctantly. none of the rest of us were offered a further drink but then we didn't expect it on such a short flight. no goodbye to most on departure just a grimace - but that didn't surprise me. it is sad to see that the bmi staff have lost all sense of pride in their jobs.",yes
no,lhr-hkg on boeing 747 - 23/08/12. much has been written about the tired old 747 fleet so i won't go in to that. what was annoying was that i was 4 rows from the front of the world traveller cabin and by the time the crew had got to my row to serve lunch 1 of the 2 choices had already run out! that in itself would have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. not very sensible offering 2 dishes almost the same. the crew did what was required of them - serve drinks and food but then we didn't see them again for 9 hours until breakfast was served. i flew home in new club world (see separate review) and my advice would be to fly in the best cabin you can afford. on a 12 hour flight it really is worthwhile.,no
no,just got back from bridgetown barbados flying with british airways and frankly couldn't wait to get off. i was so disappointed. i have travelled regularly with ba but the flights going over and coming back left a lot to be desired. the plane was in need of repair. i had water dripping from the ceiling where i was sitting and when i told the stewardess was told that was usual due to condensation and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. the toilets were so old that bits of the cladding were coming away. the food was awful and inedible. the staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. ba get your act together or you'll be losing flyers by the hundreds.,no
no,"lhr-jfk-lax-lhr. check in was ok apart from being snapped at for being too early to check in come back in 5 minutes. got through security quickly. terminal 5 has very good facilities. we boarded the aircraft and sat in our seats realising we had a long haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small seat width designed for a below averaged size person. this wasn't at all helped by the passenger in front reclining their seat immediately after the seatbelt sign went off. food was basic small meal return flight included a breakfast consisting of a small bread roll with a bitesize cereal bar. both legs went at least 4hrs without any food/drink service. ife was quite good have to watch 5 minutes of adverts before the programme starts. family near us had a child with no working ife for return flight. what annoyed us most was on the return leg we were told by the flight attendant ""do you mind moving forward so the couple behind you can eat?"". we did presuming it was policy whilst finding it strange it never happened on the outbound flight. no one else was asked to move the seat forward so we felt angered that we were the only ones asked. it is 100% not surprising ba has fallen behind other airlines in recent years as middle eastern airlines such as qatar provide a much better service for a similar price.",no
no,hkg-lhr in new club world on boeing 777-300 - 26/08/12. bought ticket in wt+ and managed to get a last minute upgrade using avios to club. first time in a premium cabin. the seats are comfortable if a little narrow but they easily move to the lie flat position meaning i was able to get 6 hours sleep. plenty of good quality champagne and wines offered before and during dinner. 3 course dinner sounded a lot better than it actually tasted. ba should think more about ease of food preparation on board rather than trying to do lavish dishes that don't quite come off. breakfast was better than expected - plenty of choice and a good selection of fresh rolls and croissants. avod worked well. my only complaint was that the cabin crew found it very difficult to be friendly. every request appeared to be an inconvenience to them - little things like milk and sugar for my coffee. generally though i would have to give club world the thumbs up if only because a lie flat bed is infinitely more appealing than cramped economy on a 12 hour flight. as i was in club through an avios upgrade i cannot comment on the value for money. had i paid full fare i might have expected more.,no
no,yyz to lhr - july 2012 - i flew overnight in premium economy on a 767. i chose this flight because on the 767 the layout is 2-2-2. i chose an aisle seat in the middle 2 so i could go to the washroom etc without disturbing y seat ate and vice versa. the seats are comparable to north american business class except with narrower arm rests. (better than economy but still not meant for sharing). the entree food was the same as business class and i wasn't really impressed. it wasn't bad but wasn't good either. i would definitely fly ba on this route again mostly because of the layout and the option to fly premium economy.,no
no,flew return in cw from lhr to bkk in august 2012. the positives of both flights were: they were on time seats were comfortable and lounges were good. the negatives were: very poor food selections on board (over cooked and uninspiring) very mixed crews - depending on what side of the aircraft you sat you got a totally different in-flight experience - some of the cabin crew should get new jobs as passengers are a severe inconvenience to them and the ife was unreliable - on both flights the ife had to be re-set at least once. overall the flights were fine and i will use ba again if the price is right.,no
no,flew lhr - vie return operated by bmi but ba aircraft. a319 aircraft was clearly new and very clean. the crew were smiling friendly and helpful. no in-flight entertainment but not a problem on this short-haul flight. delicious lunch was served - ham and mustard sub roll and unlimited drinks available. have flown british airways on this route many times now and they have never had a flaw in decent service and staff whether on the ground or in the skies.,yes
no,flight from heathrow to toronto. booked emergency exit seat for night flight home. cost £55 but worth it. overall was ok both ways except for awful breakfast prior to landing at heathrow. a freezing muffin in a piece of plastic and a polystyrene cup of coffee. not a cheap flight - better value with air transat club which costs about the same and is better in every way.,yes
no,lhr to ham. purser addresses all club passengers by name boarding a little late but left on time. food good for short flight. overall excellent.,yes
no,my son who had worked for british airways urged me to fly british airways to kansas city. he recommended me to join the executive club. i went ahead and booked my flight back in may. very reasonable price. as they are in an alliance with american airlines my outward journey was with american airlines. they were helpful even booking my seats to chicago then onto kansas at no cost. problem was on my return. i duly waited to book my seat on the chicago flight 24 hours prior to check-in. as this was with ba i tried for an hour to choose a seat to no avail. my itinerary came up but told me i was being redirected to american. so i called ba they told me i was to check in at kansas city before i could have a seat assigned. so i called american a very unhelpful person told me that i had to go to back to ba. i called ba again after explaining i had seat booked with american from kansas but could not get one with ba she put me on hold for 15 minutes and told me i had a seat - trouble was it was the one from kansas to chicago. perhaps the powers that be can sort this out. it was most frustrating. the journey was fine staff polite in-flight entertainment excellent.,yes
no,london city-new york jfk via shannon on a318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. meal served was very tasty and fresh. overall a very good flight would use this airline again.,no
no,sin-lhr ba12 b747-436 first class. old aircraft (1998) with seats that are not that private but there are only a few of us in the cabin so ok. a bit tatty but i think the planes are being replaced by a380's soon. seat itself is comfortable enough. inflight entertainment awful: fuzzy screen (low resolution lcd screen way passed it's sell-by date) with limited options. inconveniently has to be pulled around to be seen and put away for t/off and landing. seat comfortable enough for sleeping. food and service quintessentially english which is the only real reason to fly ba nowadays - the product just doesn't match other airlines. toilet cramped and awful but it has a window!,no
