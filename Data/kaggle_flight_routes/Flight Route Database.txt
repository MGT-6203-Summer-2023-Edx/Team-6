Routes database
As of January 2012, the OpenFlights/Airline Route Mapper Route Database contains 59036 routes between 3209 airports on 531 airlines spanning the globe.

Content
The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded.

Each entry contains the following information:

Airline 2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.
Airline ID Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).
Source airport 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.
Source airport ID Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see Airport)
Destination airport 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.
Destination airport ID Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport (see Airport)
Codeshare "Y" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.
Stops Number of stops on this flight ("0" for direct)
Equipment 3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces
The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available.

Notes:

Routes are directional: if an airline operates services from A to B and from B to A, both A-B and B-A are listed separately.
Routes where one carrier operates both its own and codeshare flights are listed only once.
