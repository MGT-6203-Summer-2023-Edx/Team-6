# Introduction/Background/Motivation

## Methodology/Approach
Our methodology involved the following steps:

####Data Preprocessing: We cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed variables for analysis.

####Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted EDA to gain insights into the data set's characteristics and identify correlations between variables.

####Model Selection: We evaluated four different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

####Model Evaluation: We compared the performance of the models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. We also considered insights from EDA and statistical tests to support our conclusions.

####Interpretation of Results: After selecting the most suitable model (Logistic Regression with forward selection), we interpreted its predictions and drew conclusions about the factors affecting air passenger satisfaction.
